Jun 22 16:03:30 cyphase	Meating In Session<br />
Jun 22 16:03:35 relle	Firas: are you our official secretary for this meeting?<br />
Jun 22 16:03:42 *	MichaelH (~chatzilla@pcp0011112479pcs.elkrdg01.md.comcast.net) has joined #WordPress-Meetup<br />
Jun 22 16:04:03 Firas	relle, I'll write it up but my logs are kept wackily so if someone else could post them<br />
Jun 22 16:04:09 relle	First thing we need to say is that photomatt will not be here at this meeting, unless he slips in unnoticed.<br />
Jun 22 16:04:25 relle	He is in NY or somewhere with a bunch of big wigs doing big wig things.<br />
Jun 22 16:04:35 relle	So we are going to go through the list and deal with the issues as best we can.<br />
Jun 22 16:04:37 relle	What's first up?<br />
Jun 22 16:04:44 relle	I'll post if you write.<br />
Jun 22 16:04:46 *	otaku42 (otaku@otaku42.developer.madwifi) has joined #wordpress-meetup<br />
Jun 22 16:04:49 westi	 Wiki Working Group - status?<br />
Jun 22 16:04:52 cyphase	Wiki Working Group<br />
Jun 22 16:04:57 relle	Anyone on that?<br />
Jun 22 16:05:00 skippy	yes<br />
Jun 22 16:05:06 skippy	I've shared some links to the wiki theme info<br />
Jun 22 16:05:07 relle	status - update?<br />
Jun 22 16:05:11 masquerade	nothing has been said on the list at all in over a week<br />
Jun 22 16:05:15 skippy	and heard a resounding silence.<br />
Jun 22 16:05:31 *	Podz (~Podz@82-71-7-36.dsl.in-addr.zen.co.uk) has joined #wordpress-meetup<br />
Jun 22 16:05:38 *	robla goes to look at the email<br />
Jun 22 16:05:41 twidget	okay, you were right<br />
Jun 22 16:05:42 relle	Matt implied that this might not be a good effort because the Codex was fixed so fast a couple weeks ago.<br />
Jun 22 16:05:55 masquerade	Seems that with the codex working, the idea has been semi-dropped, and now Matt said it was going to be for teching up the Codex instead, new themes and the like<br />
Jun 22 16:05:56 Firas	If I remember the last meeting's logs, matt said soething about the codex being stable now or something?<br />
Jun 22 16:05:59 skippy	I know Matt wants to sync wiki logins with forums<br />
Jun 22 16:06:09 relle	Yes, the codex is stable. The server...that's another issue.<br />
Jun 22 16:06:11 skippy	I do not know how to write the plugin necessary<br />
Jun 22 16:06:48 relle	Is it possible?<br />
Jun 22 16:06:51 Firas	So right now nobody has been delegated the themes thing?<br />
Jun 22 16:07:05 relle	Themeing is a different issue.<br />
Jun 22 16:07:12 skippy	relle: yes, it's possible; but beyond me.<br />
Jun 22 16:07:18 skippy	I took a stab, and failed.<br />
Jun 22 16:07:18 relle	The Wiki Work Group is to build a new wiki from the ground up.<br />
Jun 22 16:07:23 skippy	I shared the info with the wiki mailing list.<br />
Jun 22 16:07:35 skippy	Oh?  I didn't know that was the point of the wiki group.<br />
Jun 22 16:07:37 Firas	relle: not any longer..<br />
Jun 22 16:07:37 masquerade	relle, iirc, last week Matt changed that since the codex is working<br />
Jun 22 16:07:52 skippy	I through the wiki group was to theme mediaiwki for WP<br />
Jun 22 16:08:09 relle	No, rebuild one is what I read.<br />
Jun 22 16:08:15 masquerade	skippy, it is now, and I believe to work on the users system sync with the forums<br />
Jun 22 16:08:39 skippy	so we need to place this item on hold until we hear from Matt.<br />
Jun 22 16:08:50 skippy	For the record, I strongly oppose any effort to write a new wiki.<br />
Jun 22 16:08:57 Strings28	Agreed.<br />
Jun 22 16:08:59 robla	agreed<br />
Jun 22 16:09:00 relle	Agreed<br />
Jun 22 16:09:02 Podz	agreed<br />
Jun 22 16:09:05 cyphase	agreed<br />
Jun 22 16:09:06 shep|lappy	agreed<br />
Jun 22 16:09:10 Firas	ok<br />
Jun 22 16:09:15 Firas	Future contests coming up? Is there a guideline or advice area for people who want to start new contests?<br />
Jun 22 16:09:16 Strings28	WikiPress is a nogo<br />
Jun 22 16:09:16 relle	Wow. That's democracy in action.<br />
Jun 22 16:09:20 skippy	motion carried.  Now Matt can ignore us all, as usual.  =)<br />
Jun 22 16:09:26 westi	skippy:&#160;:P<br />
Jun 22 16:09:32 cyphase	 <br />
Jun 22 16:09:34 relle	Any one know of contests coming up?<br />
Jun 22 16:09:47 skippy	Should we solicit feedback from LaughingLizard re: his experience with the plugin competition?<br />
Jun 22 16:09:48 shep|lappy	i still vote for a WP t-shirt contest<br />
Jun 22 16:09:58 shep|lappy	it was briefly mentioned pre-new logo<br />
Jun 22 16:10:01 skippy	I can interview him, and write up a "Lessons Learned"<br />
Jun 22 16:10:14 relle	We really need to have everyone involved in the past few contests help us write up something for the codex on how to host one and what they learned.<br />
Jun 22 16:10:17 relle	Great!<br />
Jun 22 16:10:22 Podz	skippy:: Can I suggest Shadow too&#160;?<br />
Jun 22 16:10:28 skippy	shadow<br />
Jun 22 16:10:29 skippy	?<br />
Jun 22 16:10:30 relle	skippy: interview him and Alex for the two theme contests.<br />
Jun 22 16:10:35 relle	Delegated.<br />
Jun 22 16:10:40 Podz	for interview - content compo he ran <br />
Jun 22 16:10:42 skippy	Podz: send me contact info for Shadow.<br />
Jun 22 16:10:44 skippy	please.<br />
Jun 22 16:10:47 Podz	np<br />
Jun 22 16:10:48 relle	EXCELLENT.<br />
Jun 22 16:10:50 skippy	I'll contact 'em.<br />

Jun 22 16:10:54 relle	next?<br />
Jun 22 16:11:14 Firas	 Install WordPress for a Friend - Status?<br />
Jun 22 16:11:25 shep|lappy	what is this?<br />
Jun 22 16:11:29 relle	Last meeting, after it was almost done, matt brought this up.<br />
Jun 22 16:11:41 relle	It is a week/month of encouraging people to help a friend install WP<br />
Jun 22 16:11:45 Strings28	I've installed WP for lots of friends&#160;:)<br />
Jun 22 16:11:48 shep|lappy	lol<br />
Jun 22 16:11:50 shep|lappy	me too<br />
Jun 22 16:11:51 relle	He wants to use rel= to keep track of who installs<br />
Jun 22 16:11:56 Podz	ditto<br />
Jun 22 16:11:57 relle	and run a track of installers on the forum.<br />
Jun 22 16:11:59 skippy	It's a great idea; but I think it falls into two categories: new installs for never-before bloggers; and conversions for users of other systems<br />
Jun 22 16:12:04 relle	There's a page now on it on the Codex.<br />
Jun 22 16:12:13 relle	<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Matt/Rel_Ideas">http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Matt/Rel_Ideas</a><br />
Jun 22 16:12:28 relle	An great idea for spreading the gospel of wordpress<br />
Jun 22 16:12:57 Strings28	SpreadWordpress.org?<br />
Jun 22 16:12:57 Firas	Ok, so it's a good idea and we're waiting for dates and things<br />
Jun 22 16:13:02 relle	He may need some people to help him implement this, so please sign up at the top or bottom of that page that you would like to help with this project.<br />
Jun 22 16:13:05 cyphase	does installing it on your own server for a friend count?<br />
Jun 22 16:13:11 Firas	Strings28: heh<br />
Jun 22 16:13:16 shep|lappy	how about a "Convert a Xanga user to Wordpress day?"<br />
Jun 22 16:13:16 shep|lappy	lol<br />
Jun 22 16:13:24 Firas	Save a Xanga User Day<br />
Jun 22 16:13:25 Strings28	Ha ha.<br />
Jun 22 16:13:31 shep|lappy	Firas: yes!<br />
Jun 22 16:13:38 relle	There are a lot of details that have to be figured out, so if you want to help, put your name on a list on that page.<br />
Jun 22 16:13:46 twidget	Friends Don't Let Friends Blogspot<br />
Jun 22 16:13:52 Strings28	WordPress: Not just your kid sister's blogging tool.<br />
Jun 22 16:13:55 Strings28	LOL<br />
Jun 22 16:14:00 relle	We also need more ideas on promoting wordpress, so get on your idea hats and pitch in.<br />
Jun 22 16:14:17 relle	next?<br />
Jun 22 16:14:19 shep|lappy	twidget: t-shirt idea!<br />
Jun 22 16:14:22 Firas	Forum: Increased search results? Paged maybe? Status?<br />
Jun 22 16:14:24 jalenack	We should be promoting more things like weblogs.us<br />
Jun 22 16:14:24 *	ryanduff (~ryan@pcp09614033pcs.hershy01.pa.comcast.net) has joined #wordpress-meetup<br />
Jun 22 16:14:32 relle	What's the status of searches, podz?<br />
Jun 22 16:14:34 ryanduff	hi all<br />
Jun 22 16:14:40 Firas	jalenack: there are certain issues with that site<br />
Jun 22 16:14:42 masquerade	ryanduff, to shame, you're late<br />
Jun 22 16:14:52 relle	podz?<br />
Jun 22 16:14:54 Podz	searches - no changes as yet I think<br />
Jun 22 16:14:55 ryanduff	masquerade: i rushed home as quick as possible&#160;:P<br />
Jun 22 16:14:56 Strings28	Can we do something (so bold) like the Times Ad Mozilla did?<br />
Jun 22 16:15:05 relle	how is the new search going?<br />
Jun 22 16:15:11 twidget	Strings28: $$$<br />
Jun 22 16:15:12 ryanduff	masquerade: if i missed something important, please, pm me<br />
Jun 22 16:15:12 shep|lappy	Strings28: thats a bit pricey<br />
Jun 22 16:15:16 Podz	I like it - but I still use G gtoo<br />
Jun 22 16:15:17 jalenack	alright, but in order to convert blogspot users and them, weblogs.us is what they are looking for<br />
Jun 22 16:15:17 relle	New ideas go on next week's agenda, okay!<br />
Jun 22 16:15:28 relle	Any complaints or issues?<br />
Jun 22 16:15:28 Strings28	I know it costs money, but its got potential.  There are thousands of installs.<br />
Jun 22 16:15:32 Firas	Ok<br />
Jun 22 16:15:35 Firas	 Forum: Increased search results? Paged maybe? Status?<br />
Jun 22 16:15:36 masquerade	Strings28, I don't think we'd gather that amount of money, Times ads are $$$$$<br />
Jun 22 16:15:44 relle	I encountered some errors on repeat searches from the results window.<br />
Jun 22 16:16:00 Firas	Podz, do you have any info on that?<br />
Jun 22 16:16:06 twidget	Unless you know of a rich benefactor<br />
Jun 22 16:16:14 Podz	searches&#160;? no, nothing yet from matt<br />
Jun 22 16:16:18 relle	okay.<br />
Jun 22 16:16:22 relle	next?<br />
Jun 22 16:16:25 *	alexsmit1 (haunteduni@HauntedUnix-student-pdpc.sourcemage) has joined #wordpress-meetup<br />
Jun 22 16:16:28 Firas	1.6 support EVERY support request for ANY blog running code later than 1.5.1.2 WILL be closed ON SIGHT. I couldn't care if it's about CSS - it's a dead post. A link to the page Skippy made will be used.<br />
Jun 22 16:16:33 Firas	Who is I?<br />
Jun 22 16:16:37 relle	This if Forums, now.<br />
Jun 22 16:16:37 Podz	me <br />
Jun 22 16:16:38 relle	right?<br />
Jun 22 16:16:39 skippy	Me and Podz.<br />
Jun 22 16:16:43 Firas	And yeah, I'd think that's a non-controversial issue<br />
Jun 22 16:16:49 skippy	no mercy.<br />
Jun 22 16:16:50 relle	Okay, we're talking about forums.<br />
Jun 22 16:17:06 skippy	No, it's not controversial; but it needs to be made clear what the expectation will be.<br />
Jun 22 16:17:09 masquerade	Well, some people find it offensive, but eh, you guys, charge on and ignore the fools who are throwing stuff.<br />
Jun 22 16:17:14 relle	Podz: has there been any discussions yet.<br />
Jun 22 16:17:16 twidget	Binary Bonsai has downgraded saying 1.6 is buggy<br />
Jun 22 16:17:23 ryanduff	twidget: it is<br />
Jun 22 16:17:24 Firas	of course it is&#160;:)<br />
Jun 22 16:17:25 Podz	I saw that..<br />
Jun 22 16:17:28 Podz	relle:: on&#160;?<br />
Jun 22 16:17:33 relle	1.6 on the forum.<br />
Jun 22 16:17:36 ryanduff	i checked my nightly after his post and boy does it look b0rked<br />
Jun 22 16:17:40 Strings28	The forum users need to know that they're using the 'insane version' (as you implied).<br />
Jun 22 16:17:50 Podz	no - but this needs nailing now, hence my bringing it up<br />
Jun 22 16:17:54 ryanduff	functionally everthing appears, the status of posts working, i'm not sure<br />
Jun 22 16:17:56 relle	good.<br />
Jun 22 16:18:04 masquerade	We should tell matt to add a few insane filters throughout the code, like randomly insert "WP 1.6 is unstable" into posts and such<br />
Jun 22 16:18:19 masquerade	Will stop people from putting it on production blogs<br />
Jun 22 16:18:20 ryanduff	i have a nightly upgrade script that grabs the latest every night, i occasionally check it to see what the status is<br />
Jun 22 16:18:28 relle	So as it continues to stand, 1.6 is not ready for public consumption so we don't "talk" about it publicly to incite a riot of download requests.<br />
Jun 22 16:18:35 Podz	yep<br />
Jun 22 16:18:43 ryanduff	relle: not at all<br />
Jun 22 16:18:55 ryanduff	not like what happened with 1.5<br />
Jun 22 16:18:59 ryanduff	that was a nightmare<br />
Jun 22 16:19:02 masquerade	relle, should we try to enforce this to an extent in the IRC room also?<br />
Jun 22 16:19:09 shep|lappy	yes<br />
Jun 22 16:19:14 relle	What do you all think?<br />
Jun 22 16:19:15 Firas	guys, guys<br />
Jun 22 16:19:18 relle	Good question.<br />
Jun 22 16:19:25 Podz	irc is for you geeks though&#160;?<br />
Jun 22 16:19:26 masquerade	I say that it needs to be limited to an extent, but not completely blocked out<br />
Jun 22 16:19:27 shep|lappy	i think we should<br />
Jun 22 16:19:34 Firas	remember the people in IRC are free agents pretty much<br />
Jun 22 16:19:34 Reorx	It's folly to try to contain it.<br />
Jun 22 16:19:36 masquerade	Podz, the fact stands that normal users still stop by<br />
Jun 22 16:19:39 Podz	irc = problem solving&#160;?<br />
Jun 22 16:19:52 Reorx	Not everyone reads the Codex, not everyone attends this meetup.<br />
Jun 22 16:19:55 skippy	We can't (nor should we) stop people from trying bleeding edge code.  If someone comes into IRC for 1.6 help, it's totally up to whether anyone there can (and will) help<br />
Jun 22 16:19:59 Podz	masquerade:: totally agree, but then what if Ryan pops in&#160;? and asks&#160;?<br />
Jun 22 16:20:13 westi	we should probably not support users asking 1.6 Qs .. shouldn't stop us talking about it though<br />
Jun 22 16:20:19 jalenack	so 1.6 is strictly supported only on the wp-testers list?<br />
Jun 22 16:20:27 masquerade	Podz, then it continues, but conversation about grabbing 1.6 code or where to get it need to be stomped out<br />
Jun 22 16:20:34 Podz	it's not 1.6 - it's the "OOooohh factor" that needs stopping<br />
Jun 22 16:20:38 Strings28	1.6 is pre-alpha.  It's like vaporware right now.<br />
Jun 22 16:20:38 Firas	jalenack: it's not really supported at all, wp-testers is if you want to patch and write bugs etc<br />
Jun 22 16:20:39 otaku42	Podz: may i suggest to follow all the proposals seen on madwifi-docs?<br />
Jun 22 16:20:41 shep|lappy	i think it should be banned from IRC for now<br />
Jun 22 16:20:46 shep|lappy	its too buggy<br />
Jun 22 16:20:47 Reorx	1.6 should be strictly supported by anyone who wants to support 1.6 alpha code.<br />
Jun 22 16:20:49 ryanduff	Podz: irc = problem causing when it comes to users and 1.6<br />
Jun 22 16:20:53 Podz	mdwifi&#160;?<br />
Jun 22 16:21:01 relle	mediawiki<br />
Jun 22 16:21:12 Firas	my suggestion is that since we agree about the forum point, let's move on--it's silly to try to contain what goes on in the IRC room or on people's blogs<br />
Jun 22 16:21:12 otaku42	Podz: oops, sorry... i meant wordpress-docs<br />
Jun 22 16:21:28 ryanduff	why don't we just register a #wordpress-devel channel?<br />
Jun 22 16:21:33 ryanduff	and talk about it in there<br />
Jun 22 16:21:34 relle	But it is still a good thought to keep in the backs of your heads.<br />
Jun 22 16:21:38 ryanduff	announce it on the nightly list<br />
Jun 22 16:21:40 relle	#wordpress-dev would be better.<br />
Jun 22 16:21:42 *	cyphase msg's ChanServ<br />
Jun 22 16:21:43 Reorx	ryanduff: Because nothing would happen there.<br />
Jun 22 16:21:43 masquerade	I still think we should purposely put some obfuscating code in 1.6, to keep people away<br />
Jun 22 16:21:44 relle	I think that's brilliant.<br />
Jun 22 16:21:46 masquerade	:D<br />
Jun 22 16:21:57 ryanduff	so its only to the people who know of the nightlies and discuss it<br />
Jun 22 16:21:57 skippy	My proposal:  anyone who wants to support 1.6 is  free to make it know that they will do so.  _THE OFFICIAL_ WordPress support forums DO NOT supprot 1.6 yet<br />
Jun 22 16:22:07 Podz	:)<br />
Jun 22 16:22:09 relle	looks like a good decision.<br />
Jun 22 16:22:10 relle	next?<br />
Jun 22 16:22:12 cyphase	 <br />
Jun 22 16:22:13 cyphase	         Status of 1.5.2/1.6<br />
Jun 22 16:22:14 cyphase	 <br />
Jun 22 16:22:37 relle	Well, borked is one thing, but what about anything positive going on?<br />
Jun 22 16:22:41 otaku42	Podz: that would be: 1. codex page: "use 1.6-alpha and you're on your own". 2. threads in the forum get a hint towards the codex page, threads closed. 3. change version postfix of 1.6 to something like "don't ask for support!" or thelike<br />
Jun 22 16:23:00 relle	That's the status as of right now, otaku42 <br />
Jun 22 16:23:09 relle	What is happening with 1.6 status, folks?<br />
Jun 22 16:23:13 masquerade	otaku42, changing the version string will do nothing, that's been proven over and over, 1.6-alpha-do-not-use is about as explanatory as could be<br />
Jun 22 16:23:15 Podz	hint=shove&#160;:)<br />
Jun 22 16:23:18 otaku42	relle: must have missed that, sorry<br />
Jun 22 16:23:19 Firas	relle, only two people know that<br />
Jun 22 16:23:22 relle	The chatter on the mailing list has been busy lately.<br />
Jun 22 16:23:32 masquerade	relle, not much has happened in the last few days, but the UI stuff looks like its happening, which is definitely a good point<br />
Jun 22 16:23:34 relle	I'm talking generally.<br />
Jun 22 16:23:40 *	alexsmith has quit (Read error: 145 (Connection timed out))<br />
Jun 22 16:23:46 relle	UI=wysiwyg??<br />
Jun 22 16:23:55 Firas	no, general UI stuff<br />
Jun 22 16:24:01 relle	what is UI?<br />
Jun 22 16:24:02 masquerade	relle, nah, new look for the admin panel, usability concerns<br />
Jun 22 16:24:05 Firas	user interface<br />
Jun 22 16:24:08 relle	cool.<br />
Jun 22 16:24:13 Reorx	I don't like it.<br />
Jun 22 16:24:16 *	Podz thinks it's bad<br />
Jun 22 16:24:22 masquerade	define "it"<br />
Jun 22 16:24:30 Podz	drag/drop <br />
Jun 22 16:24:30 Reorx	Teh new admin is really slow.<br />
Jun 22 16:24:43 Podz	I really do not like it at all. Ugly as hell <br />
Jun 22 16:24:47 Reorx	Everything is open by default then collapses to preferences.<br />
Jun 22 16:24:58 skippy	can we theme the admin area, like we can our main public display?<br />
Jun 22 16:25:06 Strings28	Yes.<br />
Jun 22 16:25:07 skippy	can folks turn off the fancy admin if they want?<br />
Jun 22 16:25:13 Strings28	Check Codex.<br />
Jun 22 16:25:14 Reorx	You can't turn off the fancy admin.<br />
Jun 22 16:25:21 masquerade	skippy, the option isn't there, but maybe it should be?<br />
Jun 22 16:25:28 shep|lappy	yeah<br />
Jun 22 16:25:35 Firas	Reorx: that expand/collapse issue is just because it's pre-alpha<br />
Jun 22 16:25:35 Strings28	No, options are a cop=out<br />
Jun 22 16:25:45 Reorx	There are feature changes in an effort to consolidate the post interface into one code path.<br />
Jun 22 16:25:49 Strings28	Some options are, that is.<br />
Jun 22 16:25:52 Anthony	wow, i am just going to log this and learn...<br />
Jun 22 16:25:53 relle	<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="../../../Version_1.html">http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_1.6</a><br />
Jun 22 16:26:03 skippy	Don't make it an _option_ -- make it a theme, just like /wp-content/themes/<br />
Jun 22 16:26:43 masquerade	skippy, the admin section would take insane amounts of time to theme, and the work would definitely have to be placed on someone other than Matt or Ryan, as they have enough on their hands<br />
Jun 22 16:26:46 Firas	I doubt that'd happen, but it's something to think about<br />
Jun 22 16:26:56 Reorx	masquerade: agreed.<br />
Jun 22 16:27:07 skippy	well, in the absence of "options", it's the only viable suggestion I can offer.<br />
Jun 22 16:27:09 masquerade	if it was to happen, there'd need to be someone else to push it along, there's no way Matt or Ryan will get around to it<br />
Jun 22 16:27:36 Firas	masquerade: I bet an enterprising plugin buffering the the output and dropping it can kinda/sorta work like an admin themer<br />
Jun 22 16:27:37 jalenack	I don't think it would be worth the work<br />
Jun 22 16:27:51 Strings28	That would be an insane amount of work.<br />
Jun 22 16:28:01 masquerade	Firas, the end plugin would be larger than the admin section<br />
Jun 22 16:28:09 Firas	Well, the theming has to be done by others<br />
Jun 22 16:28:10 Strings28	Currently the options views are dynamically generated, are they not?<br />
Jun 22 16:28:11 Podz	I can't wait for the "my admin screen is bust" support q's<br />
Jun 22 16:28:20 masquerade	Strings28, no, they're static<br />
Jun 22 16:28:27 Firas	Podz: that's why putting it in the core is a bad idea<br />
Jun 22 16:28:31 Podz	true<br />
Jun 22 16:28:42 Strings28	So what are all of the tables handling all of the options then?<br />
Jun 22 16:28:46 Strings28	Or was that for 1.2?<br />
Jun 22 16:29:02 Reorx	Maybe if the javascript tag that includes the collapsing sections was done on a plugin hook that could be unregistered?  Then CSS could take over and normalize everything.<br />
Jun 22 16:29:03 masquerade	Strings28, the pages themselves are static<br />
Jun 22 16:29:23 masquerade	Reorx, currently, without javascript the admin panel degrades gracefully<br />
Jun 22 16:29:48 Firas	Next item: Developers/Hackers report on activities<br />
Jun 22 16:29:49 skippy	can we migrate this discussion to the hackers mailing list?  Seems like there's no strong consensus.<br />
Jun 22 16:29:49 Reorx	Right, so output the script tag from a plugin hook so that it can be disabled.<br />
Jun 22 16:29:50 cyphase	 Developers/Hackers report on activities<br />
Jun 22 16:29:51 masquerade	CSS controls all the items to begin with, javascript just modifies the CSS<br />
Jun 22 16:29:53 skippy	and we won't finish it here.<br />
Jun 22 16:30:06 cyphase	does that include plugins?<br />
Jun 22 16:30:13 Podz	I can't understand the admin priority given other concerns and i think it will end up causing a ton of forum posts, but hey ...what do i know&#160;:)<br />
Jun 22 16:30:14 *	shep|lappy agrees with skippy<br />
Jun 22 16:30:17 relle	This discussion needs to be continued on the hackers and testing mailing lists or on a channel somewhere.<br />
Jun 22 16:30:33 Firas	Ok, so<br />
Jun 22 16:30:34 Reorx	Yeah, because actual in-person discussion is not what this IRC Meetup is about.<br />
Jun 22 16:30:41 relle	So the summary of the status of development on 1.6 is that...there is a lot of work to go.<br />
Jun 22 16:30:56 skippy	Reorx: long drawn-out discussions with no resolution in sight are not what this is about.<br />
Jun 22 16:30:57 relle	Dreams of a July release might be premature.<br />
Jun 22 16:31:08 Podz	2006 is my bet <br />
Jun 22 16:31:11 Strings28	Ha ha.  July?  Surely.<br />
Jun 22 16:31:15 masquerade	relle, dreams of an august release are premature<br />
Jun 22 16:31:22 Reorx	And yet we can spend many hours discussing Codex topics with everyone back-patting and actuall performing no work there.<br />
Jun 22 16:31:24 shep|lappy	i'd say october or november<br />
Jun 22 16:31:32 Firas	Reorx: please<br />
Jun 22 16:31:41 Firas	Ok<br />
Jun 22 16:31:48 Firas	The Dev blog was down<br />
Jun 22 16:31:52 Firas	it's up now<br />
Jun 22 16:31:53 cyphase	fixed<br />
Jun 22 16:31:53 Firas	next item<br />

Jun 22 16:32:08 skippy	Codex Cleanup ++<br />
Jun 22 16:32:17 relle	Over 2000 maybe 3000 edits in the past few days alone.<br />
Jun 22 16:32:18 *	jalenack agrees<br />
Jun 22 16:32:19 Firas	Nice work guys<br />
Jun 22 16:32:28 Podz	Codex Team +++<br />
Jun 22 16:32:33 Strings28	Very cool.<br />
Jun 22 16:32:35 Firas	Backup Week: July 23-30 News out next week!<br />
Jun 22 16:32:39 relle	Hurrays go to everyone, but I especially want to point out MichaelH who just finished categorizing almost 400 pages.<br />
Jun 22 16:32:50 relle	We still have a lot of work to do and we need YOU.<br />
Jun 22 16:32:52 relle	All of you.<br />
Jun 22 16:32:57 Podz	Well Done MichaelH&#160;!!<br />
Jun 22 16:33:03 masquerade	MichaelH++<br />
Jun 22 16:33:04 jalenack	MichaelH++<br />
Jun 22 16:33:07 relle	It continues until Sunday night, so get in there and get the work done.<br />
Jun 22 16:33:07 Strings28	Fan-freaking-tastic.<br />
Jun 22 16:33:08 Firas	So Podz and Relle are the ones doing this, yes? backup week? What are you guys planning?<br />
Jun 22 16:33:18 relle	MichaelH: has no butt left or hands from all the hours of working on that.<br />
Jun 22 16:33:21 skippy	It would be swell if everyone could help pick off the low-hanging fruit.<br />
Jun 22 16:33:32 skippy	Find something you can answer -- even if it's a basic answer -- and apply it<br />
Jun 22 16:33:34 Strings28	I wrote some 'how to write a plugin' tutorials for WP, could those be adopted/adapted into Codex?<br />
Jun 22 16:33:45 relle	yes<br />
Jun 22 16:33:52 Firas	Strings28: put them in your user page and have relle give em a look<br />
Jun 22 16:33:55 relle	But there are already articles on that, so you have to check.<br />
Jun 22 16:34:00 Podz	I'll produce backup guides for cpanel / vdeck / directadmin, hopefully Plesk. I need someone to write a commandline one though<br />
Jun 22 16:34:05 Strings28	They're linked to from the Codex page.<br />
Jun 22 16:34:12 relle	Backup week is July 23-30.<br />
Jun 22 16:34:14 skippy	Podz: I can help with the comamnd line<br />
Jun 22 16:34:14 Firas	Podz: hah<br />
Jun 22 16:34:18 Firas	two lines?<br />
Jun 22 16:34:22 relle	We will be promoting this starting next week.<br />
Jun 22 16:34:23 Firas	ok, so skippy has that<br />
Jun 22 16:34:23 Podz	:D<br />
Jun 22 16:34:27 relle	Backup WordPress.<br />
Jun 22 16:34:35 relle	We will need a lot of help to promote this and get this rolling.<br />
Jun 22 16:34:39 Podz	I don't know CL&#160;:)<br />
Jun 22 16:34:47 jalenack	could you explain the Backup?<br />
Jun 22 16:34:49 relle	We want to spread it far and wide, so if you want to help, let me know on my codex user page<br />

Jun 22 16:35:00 relle	on the talk section.<br />
Jun 22 16:35:03 skippy	jalenack: make backup copies of your database and files.<br />
Jun 22 16:35:17 jalenack	...o ok<br />
Jun 22 16:35:21 Firas	jalenack: it's to encourage people who don't do it much to step back and save their data<br />
Jun 22 16:35:21 Podz	to encourage them to do it before the sh*t hits the fan<br />
Jun 22 16:35:32 relle	This will be a big thing to tie the forum and Codex together.<br />
Jun 22 16:35:57 Strings28	Is there any reason, since the Dashboard is there, that a monthly reminder couldn't be posted on one of the blogs?<br />
Jun 22 16:36:00 relle	If you or anyone you know has any plugins for quicky backups for the database, make sure you tell them to update them and make sure they work with all versions.<br />
Jun 22 16:36:14 relle	I think that's a great idea.<br />
Jun 22 16:36:21 skippy	Strings28: sure, but not everyone will read it.<br />
Jun 22 16:36:31 relle	I do.<br />
Jun 22 16:36:33 jalenack	skippy, that's our best chance<br />
Jun 22 16:36:47 jalenack	people read their Dashboards more than the forums<br />
Jun 22 16:36:51 skippy	make sure to style the text in red, so people SEE it<br />
Jun 22 16:37:07 jalenack	possible?<br />
Jun 22 16:37:25 Strings28	Who here has a blog that's on the Dashboard?<br />
Jun 22 16:37:32 Reorx	I do.<br />
Jun 22 16:37:40 Firas	Reorx: what's your site?<br />

Jun 22 16:38:41 skippy	=)<br />
Jun 22 16:38:56 Strings28	Reorx: would you mind posting monthly to backup?<br />

Jun 22 16:39:07 Reorx	Or backing up monthly.<br />
Jun 22 16:39:09 twidget	Those responsible for the sacking... have been sacked<br />
Jun 22 16:39:13 Strings28	Or should Matt be asked to do it?  Can a small script be written to pust every Month 1st?<br />

Jun 22 16:40:48 cyphase	        The WP-Plugins.org developer plugin repository now has over 300 registered plugins. Time to get that directory going! Status?<br />

Jun 22 16:41:24 masquerade	Not much on that without Matt here, unless a third-party is working on a directory<br />
Jun 22 16:41:27 relle	The plugins are a mess to find, even on the forum.<br />
Jun 22 16:41:34 relle	Is anyone working on this?<br />
Jun 22 16:41:39 Reorx	I emailed everything I had to matt, including superior code I did not publish.<br />
Jun 22 16:41:47 *	uNrEaLiTy has quit (Client Quit)<br />
Jun 22 16:41:51 Anthony	I would if I had another person to help<br />
Jun 22 16:41:54 Firas	I kinda am but won't make any promises, I think the best bet is to wait for matt<br />
Jun 22 16:41:59 Anthony	I have the time and stuff<br />
Jun 22 16:42:07 masquerade	Reorx, if you ever want something put in the core, Matt is not the place to mail it to<br />
Jun 22 16:42:24 *	mikelittle (~mike@spc1-stkp2-4-0-cust182.bagu.broadband.ntl.com) has joined #wordpress-meetup<br />
Jun 22 16:42:38 Reorx	This is for the plugin directory, not the core.  But any alternative suggestions are welcome.<br />
Jun 22 16:42:46 jalenack	could we do something like: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/">http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/</a><br />
Jun 22 16:42:52 jalenack	to grab plugins<br />
Jun 22 16:43:03 Firas	Anyone have any other issues, or should we return to discussion about wp-admin?<br />
Jun 22 16:43:14 Anthony	So should I consider doing it or am I too new?<br />
Jun 22 16:43:16 relle	Anyone know the status of the one click manager plugin?<br />
Jun 22 16:43:20 Firas	jalenack: yeah that what be nice<br />
Jun 22 16:43:25 relle	Anthony: too new.<br />
Jun 22 16:43:31 relle	soon.<br />
Jun 22 16:43:47 masquerade	I think we need a replacement for wp-plugins.net, or someone who will volunteer to take over wp-plugins.net<br />
Jun 22 16:43:47 Firas	relle: it's going to be revamped soon and i'm kinda/sorta helping with something relating to that<br />
Jun 22 16:43:52 Anthony	Well, I have been using Wordpress for 4 years<br />
Jun 22 16:43:56 Anthony	just haven't made a skin&#160;:P<br />
Jun 22 16:44:00 Reorx	The one-click manager needs to be revamped before it is put on the site, as per a previous IRC discussion.<br />
Jun 22 16:44:00 jalenack	masquerade, I agree<br />
Jun 22 16:44:03 Anthony	so in that sense, not really that new...<br />
Jun 22 16:44:16 Firas	Reorx: i shared that part with zedrdave<br />
Jun 22 16:44:18 jalenack	I'd work on that<br />
Jun 22 16:44:38 Reorx	Firas: The unzip replacement?  That was the big issue.<br />
Jun 22 16:44:39 Firas	he says wppm2 won't use shell_exec or fopen if curl is available<br />
Jun 22 16:44:41 Firas	does that sound better?<br />
Jun 22 16:44:42 relle	Then someone get together with zedrdave and see if we can get motivated with this.<br />
Jun 22 16:44:50 Firas	Reorx: yeah, shell_exec is out<br />
Jun 22 16:44:52 Firas	for WPPM2<br />
Jun 22 16:45:03 masquerade	Firas, my bets are that if wppm2 ever happens, it'll be way off in the future. We need something sooner than later<br />
Jun 22 16:45:08 Reorx	Hmm.  Ok.  That's my main barrier at the moment.<br />
Jun 22 16:45:22 Reorx	*Something* needs to go in /extend/plugins<br />
Jun 22 16:45:26 *	alexsmit1 has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))<br />
Jun 22 16:45:37 relle	That's the list matt was talking about.<br />
Jun 22 16:45:41 Firas	masquerade: well, if someone wants to splinter off and make a third plugin directory and see what they can do..<br />
Jun 22 16:45:44 relle	or a part of it.<br />
Jun 22 16:45:49 skippy	how about a list of the 5 oldest plugins in the repository with the most activity&#160;?<br />
Jun 22 16:45:51 Firas	then Anthony is welcome to try to work off the svn etc<br />
Jun 22 16:46:14 Firas	if we're talking about /extend/plugins<br />
Jun 22 16:46:15 Firas	agreed<br />
Jun 22 16:46:20 Firas	something needs to go there<br />
Jun 22 16:46:26 relle	Okay, there are a couple of things that were put on the list during the meeting. New items.<br />
Jun 22 16:46:29 relle	#  Possible hosting by wordpress.org of WordPress blogs<br />
Jun 22 16:46:29 *	element (~chatzilla@gw.cj.com) has left #wordpress-meetup<br />
Jun 22 16:46:34 relle	Anyone know about this?<br />
Jun 22 16:46:37 jalenack	i think that would be good for the widget browser thing<br />
Jun 22 16:46:39 masquerade	I think that even if we don't get a 1 click install going, /extend/plugins needs to be done<br />
Jun 22 16:46:40 jalenack	<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/">http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/</a><br />
Jun 22 16:46:59 jalenack	because it works similarly to the theme viewer already in place<br />
Jun 22 16:47:00 masquerade	jalenack, hopefully something similar could go at /extend/plugins<br />
Jun 22 16:47:05 Firas	jalenack: that's not as good as update.mozillla.org<br />
Jun 22 16:47:23 Firas	which is what we want to beat&#160;:)<br />
Jun 22 16:47:39 relle	Possible hosting by wordpress.org of WordPress blogs<br />
Jun 22 16:47:42 Anthony	okay, do i need details on what exactly todo?<br />
Jun 22 16:47:49 *	westi yawns and heads off to bed<br />
Jun 22 16:47:50 Anthony	or just make a large list of plugins<br />
Jun 22 16:47:52 westi	night all<br />
Jun 22 16:47:57 Podz	why all this push to widen/extend&#160;? I've said before that a period of consolidation would be good, yet I'm told that is a bad thing, but so is this pushing<br />
Jun 22 16:47:59 Firas	Anthony, let's return to it in a bit<br />
Jun 22 16:48:06 *	westi is now known as westi|gone<br />
Jun 22 16:48:08 cyphase	relle, i've heard something about that<br />
Jun 22 16:48:09 Anthony	alright<br />
Jun 22 16:48:13 relle	wp-plugins exist.<br />
Jun 22 16:48:13 cyphase	well, heard it mentioned<br />
Jun 22 16:48:18 relle	extend/plugins exist.<br />
Jun 22 16:48:25 relle	We need to get those consolidtated and more user friendly.<br />
Jun 22 16:48:31 Podz	'we'<br />
Jun 22 16:48:34 relle	Let's NOT add another wp repository style site.<br />
Jun 22 16:48:34 cyphase	so it's definitley a talked about thing<br />
Jun 22 16:48:35 masquerade	we need something like update.mozilla.org<br />
Jun 22 16:48:39 relle	"WE"<br />
Jun 22 16:48:55 *	jalenack volunteers to work on that<br />
Jun 22 16:48:56 Podz	if it is on wp.org, there is no 'we'<br />
Jun 22 16:49:03 skippy	correct, podz.<br />
Jun 22 16:49:04 masquerade	Podz, good point<br />
Jun 22 16:49:05 relle	royal we.<br />
Jun 22 16:49:08 Podz	no<br />
Jun 22 16:49:10 robla	whee!<br />
Jun 22 16:49:12 Podz	no rotyal we<br />
Jun 22 16:49:16 Firas	 Possible hosting by wordpress.org of WordPress blogs<br />
Jun 22 16:49:21 Firas	this is unlikely<br />
Jun 22 16:49:24 Strings28	That's a bad choice.<br />
Jun 22 16:49:28 Firas	 A WordPress branded blogging tool?<br />
Jun 22 16:49:29 twidget	masquerade: I've brought that up to Matt in the past, and he likes the idea, just says it's too big a task<br />
Jun 22 16:49:30 relle	It is already happening, but not with blogs.<br />
Jun 22 16:49:31 skippy	I doubt it will happen.<br />
Jun 22 16:49:33 cyphase	lol<br />
Jun 22 16:49:34 jalenack	what about <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://wordpress.com/">http://wordpress.com/</a><br />
Jun 22 16:49:44 Strings28	Wordpress.org could link to any other site doing that, but there needs to remain a core competancy.<br />
Jun 22 16:49:54 Podz	No royal 'we' was what I meant. WE (us here) need to be crystal about what can be done, by who and when.<br />
Jun 22 16:50:05 relle	agreed.<br />
Jun 22 16:50:12 Podz	other talk is pretty much useless<br />
Jun 22 16:50:12 masquerade	twidget, thing is, someone else could just as easily do it, but fall short of one of matt's uber high standards, and be ignored<br />
Jun 22 16:50:30 relle	What is a branded blogging tool?<br />
Jun 22 16:50:32 relle	What does that mean?<br />
Jun 22 16:50:39 masquerade	relle, its like blogger<br />
Jun 22 16:50:48 skippy	and I doubt Matt wants to conflate any-old-blog with the wordpress.org domain / brand.<br />
Jun 22 16:50:51 *	mdawaffe (~mdawaffe@qc07.theory.caltech.edu) has joined #wordpress-meetup<br />
Jun 22 16:50:51 cyphase	like a branded credit card i think<br />
Jun 22 16:50:51 Firas	or do they mean desktop client?<br />
Jun 22 16:51:00 cyphase	probably<br />
Jun 22 16:51:01 jalenack	couldn't we use <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://wordpress.com/">http://wordpress.com/</a><br />
Jun 22 16:51:07 Firas	Last time I check wp already had a branded blogging tool&#160;:)<br />
Jun 22 16:51:12 masquerade	jalenack, wordpress.com is being transferred to matt<br />
Jun 22 16:51:21 skippy	If Matt wants to host celebrity blogs, that's his choice obviously; but Matt will never let skippy.wordpress.org happen <br />
Jun 22 16:51:26 Firas	who added the item, so we can clarify<br />
Jun 22 16:51:33 relle	Please!<br />
Jun 22 16:51:37 Firas	cyphase<br />
Jun 22 16:51:39 skippy	jalenack: the folks who own wordpress.com are holding out for big $$$ aren't they?<br />
Jun 22 16:51:42 cyphase	firas<br />
Jun 22 16:51:46 cyphase	Firas*<br />
Jun 22 16:51:47 cyphase	lol<br />
Jun 22 16:51:47 Podz	it's already bad enough that if wp.org goes down, so do so many other blogs<br />
Jun 22 16:51:54 Firas	cyphase: what were you referring to?<br />
Jun 22 16:52:04 masquerade	skippy, nah, they tried to give it to matt, and he shunned them, so they got all pissed, but now he agreed so they're giving it to him<br />
Jun 22 16:52:09 jalenack	it says its under the WP team's control now<br />
Jun 22 16:52:16 cyphase	Firas, when i said what?<br />
Jun 22 16:52:16 skippy	masquerade: oh<br />
Jun 22 16:52:21 Firas	masquerade: there were issues about ownership of the domain<br />
Jun 22 16:52:33 relle	Heeeeeellllloooooooooooooooooooooo<br />
Jun 22 16:52:36 masquerade	skippy, essentially, if you missed the post, the owner said matt was a complete ass to them<br />
Jun 22 16:52:36 Podz	"WP team"  &lt;----- who are they&#160;?<br />
Jun 22 16:52:42 relle	Who listed about the branding tool on the meeting agenda?<br />
Jun 22 16:52:42 masquerade	Podz, matt<br />
Jun 22 16:52:50 cyphase	Podz, they are mysterious<br />
Jun 22 16:52:57 skippy	what relle&#160;?<br />
Jun 22 16:53:09 relle	who listed the branding tool on the meeting agenda?<br />
Jun 22 16:53:11 skippy	oh.<br />
Jun 22 16:53:14 Reorx	It ws cyphase.  Use the history tool...<br />
Jun 22 16:53:17 Firas	cyphase: when you listed the branded blogging tool thing<br />
Jun 22 16:53:22 cyphase	oh!<br />
Jun 22 16:53:23 cyphase	lol<br />
Jun 22 16:53:32 Firas	we're kinda stalled here for you<br />
Jun 22 16:53:41 relle	Okay, is there anything else on the agenda?<br />
Jun 22 16:53:41 cyphase	yea, i meant a desktop client<br />
Jun 22 16:53:48 cyphase	sorry about that, i got lost for a sec<br />
Jun 22 16:53:54 Firas	cyphase: ok<br />
Jun 22 16:54:01 cyphase	maybe it wasn't such a good idea&#160;:S<br />
Jun 22 16:54:01 skippy	oh, a "WordPress Ecto"&#160;?<br />
Jun 22 16:54:15 Strings28	Java?<br />
Jun 22 16:54:23 masquerade	cyphase, if it happens, it won't be by the official dev team<br />
Jun 22 16:54:28 Firas	well there are numerous open source ones out there<br />
Jun 22 16:54:30 Strings28	If it was written in Java you might have something because it could be cross platform.<br />
Jun 22 16:54:38 Firas	replace their logo with yours&#160;:)<br />
Jun 22 16:54:41 masquerade	Strings28, but why reinvent the wheel?<br />
Jun 22 16:54:42 Reorx	I'm not sure about a desktop tool, but a WordPress subset of XMLRPC hooks that could be used sounds like a good idea.<br />
Jun 22 16:54:52 Reorx	...for WP-specific features.<br />
Jun 22 16:54:57 Firas	Reorx: yeah<br />
Jun 22 16:55:01 skippy	Matt will rail against "subset".<br />
Jun 22 16:55:17 masquerade	Reorx, I say, if we're going to move to having WP specific features, we move away from XML-RPC all together<br />
Jun 22 16:55:17 Reorx	Matt should rally behind "trendsetting".<br />
Jun 22 16:55:18 skippy	and I rather agree... if it's not standard, should we be trying it?<br />
Jun 22 16:55:18 cyphase	masquerade, yea, i know<br />
Jun 22 16:55:41 Strings28	Standards?  What are those?<br />
Jun 22 16:55:43 masquerade	maybe something like the Atom API would be better, or some other XML based standard<br />
Jun 22 16:55:52 skippy	but I have no need for / interest in a desktop publishing tool.<br />
Jun 22 16:55:54 robla	<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://json-rpc.org/">http://json-rpc.org/</a><br />
Jun 22 16:55:59 skippy	ATOM would rock<br />
Jun 22 16:56:07 Reorx	Those higher-tech options are good considerations.<br />
Jun 22 16:56:17 relle	Okay, there is clearly a need for a dev only channel.<br />
Jun 22 16:56:31 Firas	relle: with due respect<br />
Jun 22 16:56:31 relle	Would someone like to help start the #wordpress-dev channel on the IRC?<br />
Jun 22 16:56:33 Strings28	Sorry&#160;:)<br />
Jun 22 16:56:34 Podz	when do we call it WP-CMS&#160;?<br />
Jun 22 16:56:35 mdawaffe	I'd just move it to the wp-hackers list<br />
Jun 22 16:57:02 Firas	if there aren't any other items i'd like to go back to talking about the 1.6 admin<br />
Jun 22 16:57:07 relle	I see a lot of people who really want to hash things out on a faster basis than email, so it might be a good idea.<br />
Jun 22 16:57:18 Reorx	That's what this was for, I thought.<br />
Jun 22 16:57:28 relle	Any last items to add to the agenda?<br />
Jun 22 16:57:40 relle	going?<br />
Jun 22 16:57:44 masquerade	Reorx, apparently this is for more business/future of WP type stuff<br />
Jun 22 16:57:48 skippy	I concur: revist wp-admin now<br />
Jun 22 16:57:52 relle	You all did great and we really got a lot of work done.<br />
Jun 22 16:57:53 relle	Hang on.<br />
Jun 22 16:57:54 Reorx	Apparently.<br />
Jun 22 16:58:06 twidget	Anyone need a log?<br />
Jun 22 16:58:07 mdawaffe	IRC is fast, yes, but development needs to be documented and thoughtfully discussed<br />
Jun 22 16:58:09 skippy	I have no other official business; so I don't mind going back to wp-admin<br />
Jun 22 16:58:13 Podz	I do<br />
Jun 22 16:58:14 Firas	masquerade: if there were the case we wouldn't be micromanaging the forums here<br />
Jun 22 16:58:15 relle	Thank you for being here.  Now, I think that the meeting needs to be declared over before you get onto talking bout wp-admin stuff.<br />
Jun 22 16:58:30 Firas	* if that were the case<br />
Jun 22 16:58:30 relle	Anyone second the meeting being over?<br />
Jun 22 16:58:33 Reorx	Otherwise it might actually be documented.  Wouldn't want that.<br />
Jun 22 16:58:34 cyphase	I<br />
Jun 22 16:58:41 cyphase	lol<br />
Jun 22 16:58:52 twidget	All opposed?<br />
Jun 22 16:58:52 Podz	As I posted to the lists, i think Codex needs the same clear protection that WP Code has. Right now, I don;t think it is clear<br />
Jun 22 16:58:58 cyphase	or should I say Yay?<br />
Jun 22 16:58:58 cyphase	;)<br />
Jun 22 16:59:03 relle	Then let it continue and consider the business part of the discussion over and the development talk can continue.<br />
Jun 22 16:59:11 Strings28	M33ting adjurned.<br />
Jun 22 16:59:17 relle	hang on.<br />
Jun 22 16:59:22 cyphase	Adjourned*<br />
Jun 22 16:59:26 relle	Podz: do you want to talk about this or add it to the agenda for next week.<br />
Jun 22 16:59:28 Strings28	surely&#160;;)<br />
Jun 22 16:59:49 Strings28	Codex does need some protection/validation.<br />
Jun 22 16:59:55 robla	relle: I'd like to add user permissions overhaul to next week's agenda if you think it's appropriate<br />
Jun 22 16:59:57 Podz	Agenda next week is okay I guess.<br />
Jun 22 17:00:11 relle	Not my agenda to know if it's appropriate.<br />
Jun 22 17:00:29 Strings28	Add it, it can always be removed if someone desides to do so.<br />
Jun 22 17:00:35 twidget	Anyone else need a log?<br />
Jun 22 17:00:37 relle	If it is a development discussion, it should be talked about on the mailing lists.  If it is a status report or needs a massive democractic decision...<br />
Jun 22 17:00:39 robla	ah...it's a wiki, right<br />
Jun 22 17:00:40 Anthony	and i also want to bring up the plugin directory whenever someone is ready to talk about it<br />
Jun 22 17:00:40 relle	then it can go on the agenda.<br />
Jun 22 17:00:43 Podz	meetup could do with clarity too<br />
Jun 22 17:01:01 relle	thanks, no, twidget.<br />
Jun 22 17:01:02 Podz	we give ideas, but we get nothing back really<br />
Jun 22 17:01:13 *	twidget (Charles@adsl-0-44-149.shv.bellsouth.net) has left #wordpress-meetup ("Leaving")<br />
Jun 22 17:01:22 Firas	Ok, let's adjourn the meeting<br />
Jun 22 17:01:23 Podz	times / people - just like the keys conversation last week<br />
Jun 22 17:01:24 relle	Put them on the list.<br />
Jun 22 17:01:28 relle	For next week.<br />
Jun 22 17:01:32 Firas	then we can talk about the dev work<br />
Jun 22 17:01:33 relle	I agree podz.<br />
Jun 22 17:01:38 mdawaffe	Podz: I agree - the overall goals of the meetups need to be defined<br />
Jun 22 17:01:43 Podz	no<br />
Jun 22 17:01:50 relle	ONe last thing: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="../../../Fundraising_and_Promotions.html">http://codex.wordpress.org/Fundraising_and_Promotions</a><br />
Jun 22 17:01:52 Podz	Matt needs to talk to us&#160;:)<br />
Jun 22 17:01:53 mdawaffe	(having just arrived, I feel I can speak authoritatively&#160;:) )<br />
Jun 22 17:01:54 relle	If you want to help - sign up.<br />
Jun 22 17:02:11 Reorx	relle, I think we should go back and discover what this meetup was really intended for, because that's not the impression I got.<br />
Jun 22 17:02:26 relle	Then talk to matt. It was to talk about wordpress business.<br />
Jun 22 17:02:40 Podz	it was to exchange ideas<br />
Jun 22 17:02:43 relle	"""to chat about all things WordPress."""<br />
Jun 22 17:03:00 Firas	why are dev ideas less meetingy than other ones<br />
Jun 22 17:03:07 relle	Development, Forums, contest, all the things related to the process of WordPress.<br />
Jun 22 17:03:21 Podz	I agree with everything in Mike's email - thats what I thought these would address<br />
Jun 22 17:03:21 relle	And share information on what is going on.<br />
Jun 22 17:03:32 relle	This is part of the "consolidation" of wordpress.<br />
Jun 22 17:03:38 Podz	and they are not<br />
Jun 22 17:03:40 mdawaffe	Firas: They're not, but we have here THE authorities on codex, forums right now<br />
Jun 22 17:03:41 relle	Keeping it open and letting people know what is going on.<br />
Jun 22 17:03:50 mdawaffe	we do not have THE authority for dev here<br />
Jun 22 17:03:51 relle	That is what I hope the meeting will accomplish.<br />
Jun 22 17:04:08 Reorx	And I never stifled your opportunity to discuss Codex issues, likewise I expected to be afforded the same opportunity.<br />
Jun 22 17:04:17 mdawaffe	(regardless of whether or not there shold be a THE authority on anything)<br />
Jun 22 17:04:20 relle	I'm not stifling.<br />
Jun 22 17:04:28 Podz	who is stifling&#160;?<br />
Jun 22 17:04:29 relle	Firas is the dictator of the meeting.<br />
Jun 22 17:04:40 Firas	Ok, let's not verge into a meta-meta discussion<br />
Jun 22 17:04:45 relle	agreed.<br />
Jun 22 17:04:46 Firas	So<br />
Jun 22 17:04:48 skippy	Reorx: I apologize if you feel that I stepped on your toes re: wp-admin<br />
Jun 22 17:04:51 relle	end?<br />
Jun 22 17:04:55 relle	over?<br />
Jun 22 17:04:59 mikelittle	The contrast between the openness and collaboration of the Docu team and the Dev "team" is remarkable.<br />
Jun 22 17:05:11 Firas	Anthony: ok<br />
Jun 22 17:05:20 Anthony	I am here<br />
Jun 22 17:05:23 Firas	you wanted to work on something like improving wp-plugins.net correct?<br />
Jun 22 17:05:23 Reorx	mikelittle: It would be my intention to change that if I could.<br />
Jun 22 17:05:33 Anthony	Yes sir<br />
Jun 22 17:05:39 skippy	mikelittle: your email was spot-on<br />
Jun 22 17:05:41 jalenack	Me as well<br />
Jun 22 17:05:54 mikelittle	Thanks.<br />
Jun 22 17:06:14 mdawaffe	mikelittle: I want to preface this by saying I don't know anything, and to claim a little devil's advocacy<br />
Jun 22 17:06:17 skippy	so we fork, and make WebPress ... =)<br />
Jun 22 17:06:26 Firas	ok, meeting adjourned<br />
Jun 22 17:06:29 Firas	agreed relle?<br />
Jun 22 17:06:30 mdawaffe	mikelittle: is there anythiing wrong with committng, then discussing, then changing after the fact?<br />
Jun 22 17:06:30 relle	second?<br />
Jun 22 17:06:35 skippy	second<br />
Jun 22 17:06:38 Firas	ok<br />

Jun 22 17:06:43 mdawaffe	third&#160;:)<br />
Jun 22 17:06:43 Podz	skippy:: I just want to support bloggers, not cms'ers<br />
Jun 22 17:06:45 Firas	done, it's over<br />
Jun 22 17:06:49 relle	Thanks everyone.<br />
Jun 22 17:06:53 Podz	&lt;/meetup&gt;<br />
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Development_Discussion_After_the_Meeting">Development Discussion After the Meeting</span></h2>
<p>Jun 22 17:06:53 Firas	now we can talk about mike's email<br />
Jun 22 17:06:54 relle	Now have at it devs!<br />
Jun 22 17:06:59 skippy	Reorx: what are your thoughts re: wp-admin<br />
Jun 22 17:07:17 skippy	Podz: fair enough; but the distinction will grow thin over time.<br />
Jun 22 17:07:40 mikelittle	mdawaffe: No not at all, but it's unlikely to happen.I don't believe the dev's knowledge of svn and revisio control is good enough to manage that easily.<br />
Jun 22 17:07:55 Podz	true....but the day will happen when WP=bloat and along will come a snappy litle app ..<br />
Jun 22 17:08:12 *	Strings28 (user@71-208-44-147.hlrn.qwest.net) has left #wordpress-meetup<br />
Jun 22 17:08:24 skippy	Podz: ... maybe?  I think the development has been pretty well organized to prevent a lot of bloat.<br />
Jun 22 17:08:27 Firas	Anthony: are you familiar with svn?<br />
Jun 22 17:08:35 Anthony	no<br />
Jun 22 17:08:37 mdawaffe	mikelittle: fair enough<br />
Jun 22 17:08:55 Anthony	i can become very easily though<br />
Jun 22 17:08:55 skippy	Podz: it took me a while, but I now respect Matt's aversion to rolling too much  into the core.<br />
Jun 22 17:09:07 Reorx	Sorry... Reading mikelittle's email.  Seems more important that specific "how to get rid of collapseable panels" issue.<br />
Jun 22 17:09:11 Firas	Anthony: can you email me and once i get a framework up i'll get back to you? fd at firasd dot org--gimme a week or so<br />
Jun 22 17:09:21 Anthony	alright<br />
Jun 22 17:09:49 skippy	for the record, I realized it was a one-man show when Matt introduced nofollow with _no_ discussion.<br />
Jun 22 17:09:53 Firas	only matt has the authority to say what goes on in /extend/plugins but we can surely make wppm2 beat update mozilla org hands down&#160;:)<br />
Jun 22 17:09:58 Podz	skippy:: I won't upgrade again, that I know.<br />
Jun 22 17:10:13 skippy	Podz: you won't upgrade ... from 1.5.1.2&#160;?<br />
Jun 22 17:10:17 Podz	no<br />
Jun 22 17:10:26 skippy	why not?<br />
Jun 22 17:10:30 skippy	oh, for the admin<br />
Jun 22 17:10:57 Podz	I see not a single reason to do so. Everything being added is nothing for me, therefore it is bloat<br />
Jun 22 17:11:05 skippy	Podz: ah.  Fair enough.<br />
Jun 22 17:11:12 Podz	complexity is not a total answer<br />
Jun 22 17:11:16 jalenack	Podz, I agree<br />
Jun 22 17:11:26 Podz	1.2.2 was the last blog version<br />
Jun 22 17:11:27 jalenack	it hasn't impressed me much<br />
Jun 22 17:11:52 skippy	I understand your point of view, Podz; but folks like my mom will desperately appreciate an improved admin posting interface.<br />
Jun 22 17:12:09 Reorx	The concept of "improved" is also up for debate.<br />
Jun 22 17:12:09 Firas	mikelittle: thanks for posting that<br />
Jun 22 17:12:24 Anthony	there needs to be two versions of wordpress<br />
Jun 22 17:12:25 skippy	Reorx: improved == WYSIWYG, at least.<br />
Jun 22 17:12:27 Podz	from now it's different territory, different support. The forum questions have changed massively since 1.5 and will continue to do so. The forums cannot cope in their current form<br />
Jun 22 17:12:29 skippy	for her.<br />
Jun 22 17:12:30 Firas	Anthony: No<br />
Jun 22 17:12:35 Anthony	hardcore geek that wants a site, and one for the bloggers<br />
Jun 22 17:12:36 Anthony	lol<br />
Jun 22 17:12:36 mikelittle	skippy: I agree, but are pretty drag 'n' drop expanding dockable widgets anything to do with better usability?<br />
Jun 22 17:12:58 Anthony	or at least the option for some of the stuff to be taken out, i can understand where they are getting at<br />
Jun 22 17:12:59 Reorx	WYSIWYG is not necessarily an improvement.<br />
Jun 22 17:13:09 Firas	Reorx: how come?<br />
Jun 22 17:13:12 Anthony	i use it all anyways, so I could care less for myself<br />
Jun 22 17:13:24 skippy	Reorx: not for us; but for someone like my mom, who loses the HTML cheatsheet I made for her, it will help her.<br />
Jun 22 17:13:35 Firas	Reorx: the vast majority of users should never need to lean &lt;a href&gt; or &lt;b&gt; or &lt;em&gt;<br />
Jun 22 17:14:22 Podz	point is that is will not be a plugin. If I don;t use it, then it is bloat. it IS going in<br />
Jun 22 17:14:25 skippy	I appreciate the "options are bad" point of view.  If a fully separate wp-admin theme is impractical, I think admin options to turn off the "pretty" fluff is important<br />
Jun 22 17:14:39 Anthony	i agree with skippy<br />
Jun 22 17:14:47 relle	BTW: I'm logging this and will post it on Matt's user page.<br />
Jun 22 17:14:53 Firas	lWell, WYSIWYG will surely be turn offable<br />
Jun 22 17:15:02 Reorx	I would want a "fluff off" option, too.<br />
Jun 22 17:15:03 skippy	please, relle.  Were Matt here, I'd say the same still<br />
Jun 22 17:15:10 relle	Reorx: so it will be "recorded".<br />
Jun 22 17:15:29 Firas	Ok, here's the thing<br />
Jun 22 17:15:38 Firas	what's the draggable widgets harming?<br />
Jun 22 17:15:47 Reorx	They're really slow.<br />
Jun 22 17:15:59 skippy	even after you've locked them in place?<br />
Jun 22 17:15:59 Firas	ah<br />
Jun 22 17:15:59 jalenack	they don't look good at all<br />
Jun 22 17:16:07 skippy	I know, we rewrite the admin section in Flash!  =)<br />
Jun 22 17:16:17 Reorx	Before you locak them into place.  They bounch around as the javascript executes.<br />
Jun 22 17:16:19 Podz	are they good for people with impaired vision&#160;? impaired hand coordination&#160;?<br />
Jun 22 17:16:33 Firas	skippy: actually, that might not be a bad idea for a third party<br />
Jun 22 17:16:35 jalenack	rearranging them doesn't really mean anything<br />
Jun 22 17:16:54 Anthony	is there any plans to use ajax?<br />
Jun 22 17:17:04 jalenack	most of the widgets are about one line each, so it doesn't make much difference to + or - them<br />
Jun 22 17:17:10 jalenack	Anthony... why? <br />
Jun 22 17:17:18 skippy	Aside from "Wow, cool!  Does YOUR blog do this?!"  -- how many people will find value in re-arranging the panels?<br />
Jun 22 17:17:21 Reorx	Rearranging and expending/collapsing are reasonably speedy.  It's the initial load that ain't great.<br />
Jun 22 17:17:47 jalenack	ya<br />
Jun 22 17:17:49 Reorx	The real advantage here is that the post editor is consolidated into one physical page instead of two.<br />
Jun 22 17:17:53 Anthony	jalenack - it wasn't a why question<br />
Jun 22 17:18:11 Anthony	there are certain things that it could be used for, but i guess some would consider it "bloating"<br />
Jun 22 17:18:23 Podz	skippy:: I see this stuff purely as a "MT admin looks nicer" thing<br />
Jun 22 17:18:26 Firas	Reorx: what do you think about the hackers thread of just putting a save button rather than the 2 or 3 each screen currently has?<br />
Jun 22 17:18:39 *	Firas isn't sure if owen is on wp-hackers anymore<br />
Jun 22 17:18:54 Reorx	I'm not.<br />
Jun 22 17:18:56 Firas	I wish Matt would chime in on that thread<br />
Jun 22 17:19:07 skippy	Podz: Interestingly enough, a friend of mine came to WP _specifically_ because the WP admin section is all text and CSS -- no images.  It loads super snappy on his 14.4 dialup<br />
Jun 22 17:19:25 Podz	and thats why I like it to<br />
Jun 22 17:19:27 skippy	Reorx: I saw only that you disconnected -- did you post why?<br />
Jun 22 17:19:31 mikelittle	Another consideration is that I can currently post from a lightweight browser (e.g. lynx) that's not gonna be true of the new interface.<br />
Jun 22 17:19:57 Reorx	skippy:  Nope.  I didn't.  But I think one of the reasons why might now be clear.<br />
Jun 22 17:20:01 Podz	does it make it better, or just make the OOoooooh factor go up?<br />
Jun 22 17:20:07 Firas	Reorx: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.wordpress.devel/2744">http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.wordpress.devel/2744</a><br />
Jun 22 17:20:18 skippy	Reorx: fair enough.<br />
Jun 22 17:20:18 *	jalenack much prefers the 1.5 write panel<br />
Jun 22 17:20:25 Reorx	I like that about the WP admin too, light and clean.  But that doesn't sell blog software.  Or something.<br />
Jun 22 17:20:46 Podz	it DOES make for more support problems<br />
Jun 22 17:20:48 Firas	<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.wordpress.devel/2746">http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.wordpress.devel/2746</a><br />
Jun 22 17:21:15 Reorx	Hmm.  I don't know.  You would certainly hav eto move the post status radios closer to the save button.<br />
Jun 22 17:21:43 Firas	mikelittle: if the new admin interface won't work from lynx, that's an important issue and should be discussed as you said<br />
Jun 22 17:21:43 skippy	Podz: which makes for more support?<br />
Jun 22 17:21:55 Podz	more complex admin<br />
Jun 22 17:22:23 skippy	Podz: does "more complex admin" mean "movable widgets" or "no save+continue" button?  (just making sure I understand fully)<br />
Jun 22 17:22:28 Podz	we get no questions about it right now - that will change won't it. Other questions will not reduce so forum load increased<br />
Jun 22 17:22:41 Podz	yes<br />
Jun 22 17:22:49 skippy	yes, both?<br />
Jun 22 17:23:30 Firas	Podz: the movable widgets is matt's thing, no save+continue is my/skippy's thing, the former is official in the code right now<br />
Jun 22 17:23:41 Podz	this will be a significant change. No doubt pushed through with something to make people upgrade. Such a massive change has big implications for support <br />
Jun 22 17:23:43 skippy	that's a good observation, Podz.  Aside from someone who accidentally deleted their saved post's contents and then re-saved, I've not seen any wp-admin questions<br />
Jun 22 17:24:16 mikelittle	I would have thought that desktop blogging applications fit the role of WYSIWYG-editing-before-posting need far better than a web based tool.<br />
Jun 22 17:24:33 skippy	alas, XMLRPC posting is crippled.<br />
Jun 22 17:24:43 skippy	XMLRPC posting doesn't trigger the proper plugins.<br />
Jun 22 17:24:52 Podz	why&#160;?<br />
Jun 22 17:24:57 skippy	and the apps all seem flakey.  And no one knows what an XMLRPC endpoint is<br />
Jun 22 17:25:00 Reorx	Hence the prior discussion on improving and augmenting support for those.<br />
Jun 22 17:25:20 mikelittle	So, that should be fixed. Rather than replaced?<br />
Jun 22 17:25:50 skippy	Podz: can you (without much effort) make a list of five things that are generally consdired "broken" in the forums?  That is, what gets lots of support questions?<br />
Jun 22 17:25:58 Reorx	Well, it should be fixed.  I think there is also room for improvement.<br />
Jun 22 17:25:59 skippy	I know blog-by-email is flakey at best.<br />
Jun 22 17:26:16 Firas	everyone wants better image and media upload handling right?<br />
Jun 22 17:26:20 skippy	yes<br />
Jun 22 17:26:23 Podz	rewrite rules / Image / Images / More Images / <br />
Jun 22 17:26:24 skippy	Absolutely.<br />
Jun 22 17:26:26 Reorx	Gah!  I finally get a camera phone and blog-by-email is flakey.<br />
Jun 22 17:26:36 Firas	Podz: rewriterules?<br />
Jun 22 17:26:39 Firas	what about them?<br />
Jun 22 17:26:46 skippy	Reorx: flakey insofar as people either succeed right away, or they never do<br />
Jun 22 17:27:14 Podz	people want to do strange things, or have weird permalink structures. <br />
Jun 22 17:27:22 skippy	Image upload; image browsing; image inserting -- those should get priority<br />
Jun 22 17:27:24 Reorx	skippy: Well, it works, but not with the photos.  I had a thing (replaced the old file) that did, and I don't know where that is now.  Overwritten by 1.5.<br />
Jun 22 17:27:28 Reorx	Mmm... Images...<br />
Jun 22 17:27:36 Podz	But Image handling to a point is in 1.5 and it's been ignored<br />
Jun 22 17:28:01 Podz	remove it, or improve it. One or the other. Right now it's worse than half-assed<br />
Jun 22 17:28:06 Firas	even if permissions don't let you upload images<br />
Jun 22 17:28:14 Firas	you should be able to scan a directory for jpegs<br />
Jun 22 17:28:23 Reorx	Firas:  That's acutally a huge problem.  Bigger than you would imagine.<br />
Jun 22 17:28:27 Firas	and insert them be clicking on a thumbnail<br />
Jun 22 17:28:30 Reorx	Try explaining chmod to my mom.<br />
Jun 22 17:28:31 mikelittle	Another decision made without discussion. No-one wold have agreed to move it out of the editing flow.<br />
Jun 22 17:28:34 Reorx	"Eh?"<br />
Jun 22 17:28:51 Firas	Reorx: yeah, but the question is<br />
Jun 22 17:28:54 Podz	mikelittle:: true<br />
Jun 22 17:29:02 skippy	WordPress should set permissions appropriately on all files it writes to disk.<br />
Jun 22 17:29:06 Firas	should that mean wp shouldn't support image handling at all?<br />
Jun 22 17:29:17 *	skippy realizes he should fix his gravatar plugin to do the same..<br />
Jun 22 17:29:24 Firas	I know some fine plugins out there do this wonderfully<br />
Jun 22 17:29:34 Reorx	skippy: Difficult on files that are supposed to go into directories that WP has no permission to write in.<br />
Jun 22 17:29:37 mikelittle	I would vote for something like iimage browser moving into core/<br />
Jun 22 17:29:43 Firas	but parts of them should be rolled into the core<br />
Jun 22 17:29:47 Firas	mikelittle: exactly<br />
Jun 22 17:30:23 Podz	every blog uses images. Not every blogger wants a drag/drop interface<br />
Jun 22 17:30:29 skippy	Reorx: WP should check perms before writing, and throw a sensible error.  I did that for my gravatars plugin.  It's a lot of boring code, but it works.<br />
Jun 22 17:30:40 Reorx	skippy: true<br />
Jun 22 17:30:50 Reorx	You guys realize that last I looked I was on the hook for this feature in the 1.6 Features list on Codex?<br />
Jun 22 17:30:54 Firas	Reorx: once an image has been uploaded even via ftp surely wp can facilitate insertion<br />
Jun 22 17:31:13 Firas	on the hook as in?<br />
Jun 22 17:31:22 skippy	Firas: making thumbnails is a pain, though, if the user sends a full-size image<br />
Jun 22 17:31:27 Reorx	As in, "scheduled and asked my Matt to write"<br />
Jun 22 17:31:33 Firas	hmmm<br />
Jun 22 17:31:35 Reorx	s/my/by<br />
Jun 22 17:31:48 skippy	Reorx: and what happened?  A resounding nothing?<br />
Jun 22 17:31:50 Firas	so it's something that's to be implemented<br />
Jun 22 17:31:55 skippy	not, as in, you did nothing<br />
Jun 22 17:32:00 skippy	but no follow-up from Matt?<br />
Jun 22 17:32:12 Reorx	No... There's code.  I sent him email asking some critical questions.  And...<br />
Jun 22 17:32:35 Reorx	<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://test.asymptomatic.net/">http://test.asymptomatic.net/</a><br />
Jun 22 17:33:18 Reorx	I tried to get some folks at #wordpress to offer opinions on it before, but no dice there, either.<br />
Jun 22 17:33:32 Firas	Reorx: post to wp-hackers?<br />
Jun 22 17:33:44 skippy	if there are real outstanding concerns for core functions, I think we should all approach matt to concentrate on those.<br />
Jun 22 17:33:56 Reorx	Firas: Probably a good idea.<br />
Jun 22 17:34:01 mdawaffe	Reorx: nice<br />
Jun 22 17:34:04 skippy	He can delegate all he wants; but the fact remains that specific advertised features need some imrpovement.<br />
Jun 22 17:34:19 Firas	Reorx: ooh, adding an image and joining it to the post meta is something i had thought of for a while<br />
Jun 22 17:34:22 Firas	is that what it does?<br />
Jun 22 17:34:24 *	Firas checks<br />
Jun 22 17:34:38 Reorx	The admin page (as you might expect) has changed significantly since I wrote this stuff.<br />
Jun 22 17:34:51 Reorx	Well, this isn't just adding an image to the post meta.<br />
Jun 22 17:35:15 Reorx	Each image has its own post-id and permalink URL.  The physical location of the image is in post-meta.<br />
Jun 22 17:35:43 Firas	right, so you can access it off post-slug/image<br />
Jun 22 17:35:45 Firas	that sounds cool<br />
Jun 22 17:35:50 Reorx	Yeah.<br />
Jun 22 17:36:28 Firas	So yeah, post to wp-hackers and let's check it out&#160;:)<br />
Jun 22 17:36:33 Reorx	A lot of why this seems so hush-hush is because I wanted to get a core set of working features to comment on based on Matt's suggestions before everyone started suggesting things willy-nilly.<br />
Jun 22 17:36:39 Firas	ahh ok<br />
Jun 22 17:36:52 skippy	willy-nilly++<br />
Jun 22 17:36:58 Reorx	usually. &#160;:)<br />
Jun 22 17:37:05 mdawaffe	Reorx: how do you reference the image from an object post?  Put it's uri in post_content?<br />
Jun 22 17:37:39 Reorx	No... There are template tag functions for that.  Also two new theme templates.<br />
Jun 22 17:37:55 Reorx	The reason is so that you can write descriptions for your images and also get commetns on each image.<br />
Jun 22 17:38:14 mdawaffe	but when you make a new object, how do you get the actual image into the object?<br />
Jun 22 17:38:22 Reorx	Ah.<br />
Jun 22 17:38:23 *	mdawaffe is missing something<br />
Jun 22 17:38:38 Reorx	You don't make a new object post.  There is an interface for adding images to posts.<br />
Jun 22 17:38:46 mdawaffe	ah!<br />
Jun 22 17:38:52 mdawaffe	magic<br />
Jun 22 17:39:04 Reorx	This interface looks like it's adidng things to posts, but it actually creates sub-post object posts with all the data.<br />
Jun 22 17:39:27 mdawaffe	gotcha<br />
Jun 22 17:39:30 mdawaffe	I don't suppose you<br />
Jun 22 17:39:39 mdawaffe	'll push up a screenshot when you make this more pub?<br />
Jun 22 17:39:41 Firas	Reorx: this extends to eg videos and other attachments too right?<br />
Jun 22 17:39:50 Firas	in its final form i mean<br />
Jun 22 17:39:55 Reorx	Coincidentally, this interface is integrated into the post interface, as previously requested.<br />
Jun 22 17:40:28 Reorx	I have screenshots online on my blog of certain aspects of the interface that I stole from Exhibit, but yeah, I'll all about making this stuff public when I think I've done good.<br />
Jun 22 17:40:51 mdawaffe	rawk<br />
Jun 22 17:41:20 Reorx	Firas: Yes, you should be able to define playback methods for each content type.  You will also be able to pull from alternate sources, like Flickr, seemlessly through the integrated image browser.<br />
Jun 22 17:41:45 skippy	totally off-topic, here, but way back in pre-1.5 Matt rolled in "auto-save", only to roll it out.  Would a separate table for drafts (posts and pages) help make auto-save easier?  And, to boot, make it possible to save draft pages?<br />
Jun 22 17:41:53 Reorx	...provided you have a plugin that hooks WordPress' media stuff to Flickr, which I will probably end up writing just to test the concept.<br />
Jun 22 17:42:38 Reorx	Didn't the guy (Gregory?) at twilightuniverse.com make an autosave plugin that works?<br />
Jun 22 17:42:52 skippy	dunn<br />
Jun 22 17:42:54 skippy	dunno<br />
Jun 22 17:43:07 skippy	sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.<br />
Jun 22 17:43:14 skippy	your work looks awesome, Reorx.<br />
Jun 22 17:43:19 mdawaffe	Reorx: something is afoot at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://asymptomatic.net/wp">http://asymptomatic.net/wp</a>&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://asymptomatic.net/wp/_categories">http://asymptomatic.net/wp/_categories</a><br />
Jun 22 17:43:45 mdawaffe	just letting you know if you didn't already - no need to elaborate&#160;:)<br />
Jun 22 17:43:45 Reorx	Thanks, skippy.  Validation is something I've been missing lately.<br />
Jun 22 17:44:01 jalenack	Reorx: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://twilightuniverse.com/2005/04/twilight-autosave/">http://twilightuniverse.com/2005/04/twilight-autosave/</a><br />
Jun 22 17:44:26 Reorx	mdawafe: Yeah, that's the WP-Cache plugin in action.  Woo-hoo.<br />
Jun 22 17:44:43 Reorx	Lots of issues since the server migration.  All WP software.  &lt;sigh&gt;<br />
Jun 22 17:45:06 Reorx	jalenack: Yeah, I think that's it.<br />
Jun 22 17:48:18 Reorx	Alright.  Considering I had given up on this WordPress madness, and now I'm 45 minutes late from sitting with the kids, I'm calling it a day.<br />
Jun 22 17:49:18 skippy	g'night all.<br />
Jun 22 17:49:21 skippy	I'm out, too.<br />
Jun 22 17:49:23 *	skippy (~skippy@skippy.net) has left #wordpress-meetup ("Free as in Puppies!")<br />
