<br />[17:12] &lt;relle&gt; PotterSys: you taking notes?
<br />[17:12] &lt;PotterSys&gt; yes
<br />[17:13] &lt;PotterSys&gt; the recorder is on
<br />[17:13] &lt;relle&gt; Congrats to everyone for the WordPress Download turning over 450,000
<br />[17:13] &lt;relle&gt; WEEEE
<br />[17:13] &lt;photomatt&gt; is the agenda ready to go?
<br />[17:13] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Where is that counter, again?
<br />[17:13] &lt;relle&gt; yes
<br />[17:13] &lt;Jalenack&gt; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://wordpress.org/download/counter/">http://wordpress.org/download/counter/</a>
<br />[17:14] &lt;relle&gt; What's the new count now?
<br />[17:14] &lt;ringmaster&gt; 454,361
<br />[17:14] &lt;photomatt&gt;&#160;:)
<br />[17:14] &lt;relle&gt; Wow.
<br />[17:14] &lt;masq|lappy&gt; photomatt, going to have a party for half a million?
<br />[17:14] &lt;photomatt&gt; probably
<br />[17:14] &lt;photomatt&gt; we just had one for ryan a few weeks ago
<br />[17:14] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; That counter is for all versions of 1.5, right?
<br />[17:15] &lt;photomatt&gt; yes
<br />[17:15] &lt;relle&gt; Or save it for million since it is turning over so fast&#160;;-)
<br />[17:15] &lt;relle&gt; party one week for 1/2 million and party for million two weeks later. Party all the time.
<br />[17:15] &lt;relle&gt; hee hee
<br />[17:15] &lt;stevecooley&gt; haha
<br />[17:15] &lt;photomatt&gt; let's start going through the agenda
<br />[17:15] &lt;relle&gt;  Firas Elixir
<br />[17:15] &lt;photomatt&gt; I have no idea what that is
<br />[17:15] &lt;stevecooley&gt; sounds like a sports drink
<br />[17:16] &lt;Firas&gt; ah, i have nothing to report about it, i'm not sure why it was stacked on top&#160;:)
<br />[17:16] &lt;Firas&gt; its that directory thing i've been working on
<br />[17:16] &lt;relle&gt; Please explain what it is.
<br />[17:16] &lt;Firas&gt; it's just a reincarnation of wp-plugins.net with tags instead of cats etc
<br />[17:16] &lt;relle&gt; and?
<br />[17:17] &lt;Jalenack&gt; directory for themes and plugins, with a plugin for one click installs
<br />[17:17] &lt;relle&gt; The name is undergoing changes right now.
<br />[17:17] &lt;Firas&gt; that's all, i'll report more a couple weeks down the road when we have something to show&#160;:)
<br />[17:17] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; Is it a reincarnation or something better? If the only change is cats to tags, I don't see the point...&#160;:\
<br />[17:17] &lt;photomatt&gt; why is this not going on wordpress.org?
<br />[17:17] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; Ah, one click, I shut up now.
<br />[17:18] &lt;relle&gt; As extend.wordpress.org?
<br />[17:18] &lt;relle&gt; or something like that?
<br />[17:18] &lt;masq|lappy&gt; tunicwriter, it also interacts a bit with the wp-plugins.org repository
<br />[17:18] &lt;Firas&gt; photomatt: the point is that once it's mature we can work on putting it in wp.org if you'd like, rather than developing it there
<br />[17:18] &lt;photomatt&gt; gotcha
<br />[17:18] &lt;ringmaster&gt; From what I understood, the software itself may be open source?
<br />[17:18] &lt;Firas&gt; it's straight GPL, reusing lots of wp functions
<br />[17:19] &lt;photomatt&gt; cool
<br />[17:19] &lt;photomatt&gt; 1.6 status
<br />[17:19] &lt;Jalenack&gt; and jefte is designing it..
<br />[17:19] &lt;photomatt&gt; "it's rocking along"
<br />[17:19] &lt;Jalenack&gt; ok
<br />[17:19] &lt;masq|lappy&gt; photomatt, nice set of commits last night
<br />[17:19] &lt;masq|lappy&gt; or this morning, whichever it was
<br />[17:20] &lt;photomatt&gt; just cleaning up some bugs the gardeners had highlighted
<br />[17:20] &lt;photomatt&gt; I talked to Ryan last night, he'll be back in a bit, he's in the middle of a move
<br />[17:20] &lt;photomatt&gt; he'll be moving to california, actually&#160;:)
<br />[17:20] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; bay area?
<br />[17:21] &lt;photomatt&gt; roughly
<br />[17:21] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; shibby
<br />[17:21] &lt;photomatt&gt; BBC Announcement
<br />[17:21] &lt;photomatt&gt; what's that?
<br />[17:21] &lt;relle&gt; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4737671.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4737671.stm</a>
<br />[17:21] &lt;relle&gt; BBC mentioned WordPress
<br />[17:21] * relle faints
<br />[17:21] &lt;relle&gt; Just a little mention but it was still a cool find.
<br />[17:21] &lt;relle&gt; That's it.
<br />[17:21] &lt;photomatt&gt; we're also in this article: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.technorati.com/weblog/2005/08/34.html">http://www.technorati.com/weblog/2005/08/34.html</a>
<br />[17:22] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; Oh! Look! Mentioned before MT, but after all the free-hosted stuff...
<br />[17:22] &lt;mikelittle&gt; It seems to have stemmed from a technorati blog post, and unfortunately billed WP as a blogging service.
<br />[17:22] &lt;relle&gt; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000332.html">http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000332.html</a> and here
<br />[17:22] &lt;relle&gt; For State of the Blogosphere.
<br />[17:22] &lt;relle&gt; Which is probably the same article.
<br />[17:22] &lt;mikelittle&gt; I've seen the story mirrored all over the net. It even made it into my local free paper today! But no mention of WP
<br />[17:23] &lt;photomatt&gt; we also got a shoutout from MySQL - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.mysql.com/news-and-events/news/article_925.html">http://www.mysql.com/news-and-events/news/article_925.html</a>
<br />[17:23] &lt;relle&gt; Call them up and complain!
<br />[17:23] &lt;relle&gt; Very exciting stuff.
<br />[17:24] &lt;relle&gt; The PR team is collecting these so let us know when you find them.
<br />[17:24] &lt;Firas&gt; wow
<br />[17:24] &lt;Firas&gt; mysql?
<br />[17:24] &lt;Firas&gt; congrats!
<br />[17:25] &lt;Firas&gt; mentioned alongside: Wikipedia, Craigslist, Feedster, Flickr, &amp;c
<br />[17:25] &lt;stevecooley&gt; good company to be in
<br />[17:25] &lt;ringmaster&gt; When my mom knows what WordPress is without telling her first, then I'll be really impressed.
<br />[17:25] &lt;relle&gt; Next?  IRC
<br />[17:25] &lt;photomatt&gt; I got a note from Marten Mickos earlier today, hopefully we can follow up on that and get some MySQL resources helping us out
<br />[17:26] &lt;photomatt&gt; what are we discussing about IRC?
<br />[17:27] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; Was the matter ever really resolved?
<br />[17:27] &lt;relle&gt; In the meeting last week, there was a discussion about an "invasion" from a bad person and the need for volunteer ops to kick those people out.
<br />[17:27] &lt;relle&gt; Guidelines were to be written on what that meant.
<br />[17:27] &lt;relle&gt; Were they?
<br />[17:28] &lt;photomatt&gt; ops wouldn't have made a difference
<br />[17:28] &lt;photomatt&gt; in situations like that someone from freenode has to handle it
<br />[17:28] &lt;masq|lappy&gt; I think they mean in the general invasion of an impolite person more than that exact situation
<br />[17:28] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; indeed.
<br />[17:29] &lt;masq|lappy&gt; I don't think we'll see that situation again, I sent the VERSION string that the software used to send that attack has to freenode admins, so the attackers will have trouble getting on int he first place
<br />[17:30] &lt;relle&gt; so is the issue of ops in the channel now dead?
<br />[17:32] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; We need something in place, I think (not that my opinion is worth a great deal). Matt isn't always there, so therefore there's no op there if someone gets particularly... "impolite," as masq|lappy put it...
<br />[17:33] &lt;photomatt&gt; okay let's move on
<br />[17:33] &lt;relle&gt; wait
<br />[17:33] &lt;relle&gt; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/08/02/tech/main713494.shtml">http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/08/02/tech/main713494.shtml</a>
<br />[17:33] &lt;relle&gt; The Blog Born every second article is not on CBS NEws
<br />[17:33] &lt;relle&gt; With a link to WordPress in the article.
<br />[17:33] &lt;relle&gt; WEEEE
<br />[17:33] &lt;relle&gt; sorry.
<br />[17:33] &lt;relle&gt; Just brought to my attention.
<br />[17:33] &lt;photomatt&gt; wow technorati is getting some amazing distribution
<br />[17:34] &lt;Firas&gt; good point
<br />[17:34] &lt;relle&gt; Oh, BBC.&#160;;-)
<br />[17:34] &lt;relle&gt; or BBC&#160;;-)
<br />[17:34] &lt;photomatt&gt; I guess it was smart to partner with them early
<br />[17:34] &lt;relle&gt; good work.
<br />[17:34] &lt;photomatt&gt; Backup Week
<br />[17:34] &lt;photomatt&gt; is that still going on?
<br />[17:35] &lt;relle&gt; Well, there is still questions and stuff on the forum.
<br />[17:35] &lt;relle&gt; Podz?
<br />[17:35] &lt;relle&gt; The "week" is over but we're leaving the banner up on the Codex through the week.
<br />[17:35] &lt;Podz&gt; there will always be questions on the forum, but the stickies have been removed
<br />[17:36] &lt;photomatt&gt; about promoting things on the Codex
<br />[17:36] &lt;relle&gt; There were over 3000 technorati links to wordpress backups which is good spreading of the word.
<br />[17:36] &lt;photomatt&gt; let's remember that most people are going there looking for something specific, rather than as a general portal
<br />[17:37] &lt;photomatt&gt;  crawler for powered by wordpress
<br />[17:38] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; is this the wordsmote (or whatever) thing?
<br />[17:38] &lt;photomatt&gt; nope
<br />[17:38] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; building a DB of all WP sites?
<br />[17:38] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; This is in reference to that post on wp-hackers?
<br />[17:39] &lt;Jalenack&gt; (just added an item to the agenda)
<br />[17:40] &lt;photomatt&gt; I guess so
<br />[17:40] &lt;photomatt&gt; I don't know who added it
<br />[17:40] &lt;relle&gt; I did.
<br />[17:40] &lt;photomatt&gt; but I'll be happy to make Ping-O-Matic data to anyone interested in doing a blog census
<br />[17:40] &lt;relle&gt; That's why.
<br />[17:41] &lt;photomatt&gt; so contact me if there's interest
<br />[17:41] &lt;photomatt&gt; moving on:  fundraising effort for fall
<br />[17:41] &lt;relle&gt; We need a good fundraising event for the fall and the fundraising and events team is looking for help and ideas.
<br />[17:41] &lt;relle&gt; Please! No wet t-shirt contests!
<br />[17:41] &lt;relle&gt;&#160;;-)
<br />[17:42] &lt;relle&gt; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="../../../Fundraising_and_Promotions.html">http://codex.wordpress.org/Fundraising_and_Promotions</a>
<br />[17:42] &lt;Firas&gt; that never gets old huh?&#160;:p
<br />[17:42] &lt;relle&gt; hee hee
<br />[17:42] &lt;photomatt&gt; honestly with regards to fundraising, perhaps we should hold off on it
<br />[17:42] &lt;photomatt&gt; simply because we don't need any money
<br />[17:42] &lt;photomatt&gt; and I'd rather save fundraising for a time when/if it's needed
<br />[17:42] &lt;relle&gt; photomatt: it takes TIME to create a good fundraiser and money will always be needed.
<br />[17:43] &lt;relle&gt; Getting people used to giving money once or twice a year is a guarantee of money in the future.
<br />[17:43] &lt;relle&gt; So put it in a good investment account.
<br />[17:43] Auto away:� 30mins of no action
<br />[17:43] Auto Away deactivated, manual Away set:�10 Auto Away:� 30mins of no action
<br />[17:43] Auto away is active
<br />[17:43] &lt;relle&gt; The time you need the money will be overnight, not with weeks of planning.
<br />[17:43] &lt;stevecooley&gt; well..are you registered as a 503c&#160;? or whatever?
<br />[17:43] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; I agree with relle on that one. It takes planning, research, planning, pr, planning... planning...
<br />[17:43] &lt;relle&gt; And it is good publicity and gets a lot of people involved.
<br />[17:43] &lt;photomatt&gt; stevecooley: no we're not
<br />[17:43] &lt;photomatt&gt; which complicates things
<br />[17:43] &lt;stevecooley&gt; yes, definitely
<br />[17:43] &lt;relle&gt; What is it?
<br />[17:43] Back:� Away for 30mins 35secs
<br />[17:43] Away Deactivated:�4 Auto Away reactivated
<br />[17:44] &lt;relle&gt; What is the incorporation status?
<br />[17:44] &lt;photomatt&gt; right now it's a matt-oh-three-cee
<br />[17:44] &lt;stevecooley&gt; putting it in a good investment account would constitute taxable income for matt
<br />[17:44] &lt;Firas&gt; any plans to get wp incorporated as a 503?
<br />[17:44] &lt;Firas&gt; that'd make lots of sense
<br />[17:44] &lt;relle&gt; oh.
<br />[17:44] &lt;relle&gt; Well. That kills a lot of things.
<br />[17:44] &lt;photomatt&gt; non profits are a major PITA, and somewhat limiting. I think we should look to Mozilla
<br />[17:45] &lt;relle&gt; and they are?
<br />[17:45] &lt;relle&gt; LLC?
<br />[17:45] &lt;Firas&gt; they just made a taxable spinoff
<br />[17:45] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; They are not-for-profit, I think.
<br />[17:45] &lt;photomatt&gt; they have a non-profit and a taxable corporation
<br />[17:45] &lt;photomatt&gt; this is recent, as it happened today
<br />[17:45] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.mozilla.org/reorganization/">http://www.mozilla.org/reorganization/</a>
<br />[17:45] &lt;stevecooley&gt; Hey, just declare yourself a religion, same effect&#160;;)
<br />[17:45] &lt;photomatt&gt; ha!
<br />[17:46] &lt;Firas&gt; stevecooley: best thing ever said in a wp meetup&#160;:)
<br />[17:46] &lt;relle&gt; Matt are you at least an LLC?
<br />[17:46] &lt;Firas&gt; Donate to the WP Religion
<br />[17:46] &lt;relle&gt; Or X?
<br />[17:46] &lt;relle&gt; Or X
<br />[17:46] &lt;relle&gt; sorry. S corp
<br />[17:46] &lt;relle&gt; fingers broke.
<br />[17:46] &lt;photomatt&gt; so my preference is, since all the costs are being covered right now and no one is on the street begging for food, to encourage people to donate TIME rather than money
<br />[17:47] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; How is WP Inc incorporated?
<br />[17:47] &lt;photomatt&gt; technically it's a c-corp
<br />[17:48] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; k
<br />[17:48] &lt;photomatt&gt; however that's not where donations go
<br />[17:48] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; right
<br />[17:48] &lt;photomatt&gt; the inc. covers all the costs that donations don't
<br />[17:49] &lt;photomatt&gt; so in the future there will be a real foundation/.org, but it's not really needed right now and I'd rather let other projects do it and make any mistakes first
<br />[17:50] &lt;photomatt&gt; the inc stuff needs to be separate, and it is, it's more a community benefactor than something people should donate money to
<br />[17:50] &lt;Firas&gt; photomatt, there's a bit of nebulousness/uncertainty about the orgs built around wp, such as this mysterious wordpress inc
<br />[17:50] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; Where does inc get its money from - benefactors?
<br />[17:50] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; What -is- wordpress, inc., heh...
<br />[17:51] &lt;photomatt&gt; the goal, eventually, is for it to be the biggest contributor someday, supporting community members to work on WP full-time
<br />[17:51] &lt;Firas&gt; is it the thing we talked about Donncha being involved with?
<br />[17:51] &lt;photomatt&gt; similar to how the moz corp generates revenue, but it's all driven back into open source code and products
<br />[17:51] &lt;photomatt&gt; yep
<br />[17:52] &lt;Firas&gt; cool
<br />[17:52] &lt;Firas&gt; so if there are any plans for a writeup or something about what it is and where it's going (maybe just a blog entry) it could be useful when it's gotten around to
<br />[17:53] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; So will it be more like bringing in freelance, say, plugin writers from time to time to do some stuff and pay them, or will it be a bit more permanent?
<br />[17:53] &lt;photomatt&gt; so while I recognize that fundraising is right for some organizations, I would rather that WP can run and flourish without bugging people for money 3 times a year
<br />[17:53] &lt;photomatt&gt; Firas: of course, I think these discussions are helpful in formulating that too
<br />[17:53] &lt;photomatt&gt; it's not all figured out yet
<br />[17:53] &lt;photomatt&gt; all of your feedback is shaping what's going to happen
<br />[17:54] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; Then why hasn't it really been discussed here before now?&#160;:\
<br />[17:54] &lt;stevecooley&gt; for the curious - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501C3">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501C3</a>
<br />[17:54] &lt;photomatt&gt; tunicwriter: it's come up a few times
<br />[17:54] &lt;Firas&gt; tunicwriter: it has
<br />[17:54] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; What's mozilla's revenue source?
<br />[17:54] * mdawaffe can't do arithmetic - money is mysterious
<br />[17:54] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; Figures, one of the, like, 3 meetups I missed...
<br />[17:55] &lt;photomatt&gt; firefox generates a lot of money from its google and amazon partnerships
<br />[17:55] &lt;Firas&gt; netscape donation upon cutoff, and arrangements with search engines and the like
<br />[17:55] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; photomatt: so can you explain how inc. gets it money and donations to wordpress and how they interact if they do interact...?
<br />[17:55] &lt;masq|lappy&gt; not to mention fundraisers (NYT ad for example)
<br />[17:55] &lt;Firas&gt; masq|lappy: yeah but the donations don't really make a dent towards paying salaries, i don't think
<br />[17:56] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; k - that's impressive
<br />[17:56] &lt;masq|lappy&gt; Firas, definitely not, but it is a fairly large source of income
<br />[17:56] &lt;photomatt&gt; sure
<br />[17:56] &lt;photomatt&gt; donations go into a paypal account which I don't use except for WP stuff
<br />[17:56] &lt;photomatt&gt; I pay taxes on it, which isn't ideal, but it's not enough to make a difference
<br />[17:57] &lt;relle&gt; yet
<br />[17:58] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; And inc.?
<br />[17:58] &lt;photomatt&gt; the inc is a separate org whose goal is to support OS development and services
<br />[17:58] &lt;photomatt&gt; right now it gets its money from partnerships and me
<br />[17:59] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; Will the donations part eventually be wrapped up into inc.?
<br />[17:59] &lt;photomatt&gt; no I don't think it should be
<br />[17:59] &lt;photomatt&gt; let's just say worse case scenario, the inc disappears tomorrow
<br />[17:59] &lt;photomatt&gt; wordpress.org can and should continue, that's why it's separate
<br />[18:00] &lt;stevecooley&gt; right, in the event of a liability for the inc, assets are assets
<br />[18:00] &lt;photomatt&gt; it's a layer of protection
<br />[18:00] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; Good point. So the donations go solely to wp.org?
<br />[18:00] &lt;photomatt&gt; exactly
<br />[18:00] &lt;stevecooley&gt; if donations are part of the inc's assets, they get swallowed into the liability
<br />[18:00] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; and it's... childlings?
<br />[18:00] &lt;photomatt&gt; stevecooley nailed it
<br />[18:00] &lt;stevecooley&gt; I've been around the block&#160;;)
<br />[18:00] &lt;photomatt&gt; so by keeping all that separate organization, all of wp.org and such is protected
<br />[18:01] &lt;stevecooley&gt; that's a very good strategy
<br />[18:01] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; Is it possible to set up a NFP for the donations that remains sep from wp inc?
<br />[18:01] &lt;stevecooley&gt; it has the persistence of the project in it's intentions
<br />[18:02] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; (I understand that the current level of donations may not warrant this yet)
<br />[18:02] &lt;photomatt&gt; mdawaffe: in the future, yes
<br />[18:02] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; k
<br />[18:02] &lt;photomatt&gt; at some point I would like that to be one of the first major donations from the inc to wordpress, covering the legal costs and hassles of setting that up
<br />[18:03] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; makes sense
<br />[18:03] &lt;photomatt&gt; however that's down the road, not going to happen in 2005
<br />[18:03] &lt;photomatt&gt; does that cover everyone's questions?
<br />[18:04] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; mine
<br />[18:04] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; Last one... Who's currently employed by the inc. right now?
<br />[18:04] &lt;stevecooley&gt; maybe a codex page would be good for this?
<br />[18:04] &lt;relle&gt; stevecooley: it's "in the works"
<br />[18:05] &lt;photomatt&gt; stevecooley: there'll be a whole website about it!
<br />[18:05] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; (inc would need its own site)
<br />[18:05] &lt;masq|lappy&gt; photomatt, wordpress.com right?
<br />[18:05] &lt;stevecooley&gt;&#160;:) ok, good ideas
<br />[18:05] &lt;photomatt&gt; tunicwriter: only donncha right now, ryan part-time in the future
<br />[18:05] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; and yourself?
<br />[18:06] &lt;photomatt&gt; nope
<br />[18:06] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; Really? You don't work for your own project's incorporated entity?&#160;:o
<br />[18:06] &lt;photomatt&gt; I already get to work on WP and make a living
<br />[18:06] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; Ah.
<br />[18:07] &lt;stevecooley&gt; I'm sure you're an executive in the corporation, you just don't take a salary?
<br />[18:07] &lt;photomatt&gt; yes
<br />[18:07] &lt;stevecooley&gt; or, a member of the board of directors
<br />[18:07] &lt;stevecooley&gt; 3 to incorporate
<br />[18:08] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; So what's your capacity within the inc. then?
<br />[18:08] &lt;photomatt&gt; it's not that formal
<br />[18:09] &lt;photomatt&gt; when it's all figured out I'll let you know&#160;:)
<br />[18:09] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; Alright, then, I'm done with my barrage of questions. Continue on&#160;;)
<br />[18:09] &lt;photomatt&gt; thanks for your interest
<br />[18:10] &lt;photomatt&gt; next: masquerade's new plugin
<br />[18:10] &lt;masq|lappy&gt; who? what? which plugin?
<br />[18:10] &lt;relle&gt; The ping thing
<br />[18:10] &lt;photomatt&gt; spring ping thing?
<br />[18:10] &lt;relle&gt; We have been getting a LOT of complaints and questions on the forum about long waits when posting.
<br />[18:11] &lt;relle&gt; lol
<br />[18:11] &lt;masq|lappy&gt; relle, you can talk, you volunteered it&#160;:-P
<br />[18:11] &lt;relle&gt; masq|lappy: came up with a plugin to help battle it.
<br />[18:11] &lt;photomatt&gt; pingomatic is adding a new server this week
<br />[18:11] &lt;relle&gt; We're also working on an article about it.
<br />[18:11] &lt;photomatt&gt; if that's the cause of the slowdown
<br />[18:11] &lt;Firas&gt; photomatt: it's more about which hook the ping is assigned to
<br />[18:11] &lt;relle&gt; Will the new server speed up the load time for saving posts?
<br />[18:11] &lt;masq|lappy&gt; photomatt, combo of pingomatic and pinging everything before displaying page content
<br />[18:11] &lt;Firas&gt; i think masq's plugin does it on shutdown?
<br />[18:11] &lt;photomatt&gt; gotcha
<br />[18:11] &lt;masq|lappy&gt; Firas, yep
<br />[18:11] &lt;photomatt&gt; we used to try and redirect people before all that stuff was processed
<br />[18:12] &lt;photomatt&gt; if you found a better way, please trac it as a patch for 1.6 as well
<br />[18:12] &lt;Firas&gt; so the reason it's a relevant issue is that maybe some of its ideas can be rolled into the core
<br />[18:12] &lt;Firas&gt; yeah
<br />[18:12] &lt;masq|lappy&gt; photomatt, sending a redirect header doesn't help unless the page dies out directly afterwards, otherwise the headers aren't considered until the request is finished
<br />[18:13] &lt;photomatt&gt; I think it depends on whether output buffering or gzip is on
<br />[18:13] &lt;photomatt&gt; once the browser gets that header, it goes
<br />[18:13] &lt;photomatt&gt; however it's sometimes buffered somewhere along the way
<br />[18:13] &lt;photomatt&gt; the script waits for more output until it gets to the end
<br />[18:13] &lt;photomatt&gt; mod_gzip buffers
<br />[18:13] &lt;photomatt&gt; anyway, looking forward to seeing it
<br />[18:13] &lt;masq|lappy&gt; photomatt, it will go once it gets all the headers, so when the first bit of output is started
<br />[18:14] &lt;photomatt&gt; cool
<br />[18:14] &lt;masq|lappy&gt; which is after pinging
<br />[18:14] &lt;masq|lappy&gt; so, moving pinging to shutdown works, helps out
<br />[18:14] &lt;photomatt&gt; next up: forum volunteers
<br />[18:14] &lt;masq|lappy&gt; I'll see about submitting a patch to trac in a few minutes
<br />[18:14] &lt;relle&gt; speaking of which, kudos again to skippy and ringmaster for the awesome backup plugin. It's been tested on huge databases and is a hit.
<br />[18:15] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Neat.
<br />[18:15] &lt;relle&gt; There was talk of including a "one click" backup in 1.6 and this might be worth considering.
<br />[18:15] &lt;photomatt&gt; hear hear
<br />[18:15] &lt;relle&gt; There's even a progress bar for the backup duration.
<br />[18:15] &lt;relle&gt; weeeee
<br />[18:15] &lt;relle&gt; it didn't break on my 60 meg database!&#160;;-)
<br />[18:15] &lt;photomatt&gt; let's start to wrap the meeting up
<br />[18:16] &lt;Firas&gt; one more thing that'd be useful in the core (again from skippy) is wp-cron, i'll bring it up on wp-hackers sometime
<br />[18:16] &lt;photomatt&gt; we should just include a skippy pack with 1.6&#160;;)
<br />[18:16] &lt;Firas&gt; lol
<br />[18:16] &lt;relle&gt; Forum volunteers: sign up for the mailing list - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="../../../Support_Forum_Volunteers.html">http://codex.wordpress.org/Support_Forum_Volunteers</a>
<br />[18:16] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; or make him a dev...
<br />[18:18] &lt;relle&gt; NEXT:  the write tab and custom fields
<br />[18:18] &lt;stevecooley&gt; so here's a weird story.  I had a friend of a friend email me saying "hey, do you want to test out this wp plugin that lets you submit local business reviews, and in exchange we drive traffic to your site."
<br />[18:19] &lt;stevecooley&gt; so I grab it, and it turns out to be a whole custom post writing subtab
<br />[18:19] &lt;stevecooley&gt; and then I was also looking at an iTunes helper thing for podcasting
<br />[18:19] &lt;stevecooley&gt; and it had a bunch of custom field form fields
<br />[18:20] &lt;stevecooley&gt; is the article writing screen open to plugins?  should these people putting out these plugins be doing more homework on how to do what they want without having to custom roll a whole-nother version of that page?
<br />[18:21] &lt;stevecooley&gt; fyi&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.insiderpages.com/">http://www.insiderpages.com</a>
<br />[18:21] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; I don't know if there are hooks, but there's always JS and the DOM
<br />[18:21] &lt;ringmaster&gt; There are a lot of plugins that affect the UI without rewriting the whole post-editing page.
<br />[18:21] &lt;Firas&gt; i don't think plugins uploaded solely to wp-content/ have an admin menu hook for write
<br />[18:21] &lt;Firas&gt; i could be mistaken
<br />[18:21] &lt;masq|lappy&gt; there are edit screen hooks, a bit of CSS magic and you could do about anything you want with it
<br />[18:22] &lt;stevecooley&gt; from within a plugin?
<br />[18:22] &lt;Firas&gt; the structured blogging plugin
<br />[18:22] &lt;stevecooley&gt; I just wanted to throw it out here that people are starting to look at wordpress as a distributed content submission engine
<br />[18:22] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; yeah - there are hooks
<br />[18:23] &lt;Firas&gt; makes a useful usage of write tabs
<br />[18:23] &lt;masq|lappy&gt; edit_screen and edit_screen_advanced iirc
<br />[18:23] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Yeah, use admin_header or admin_footer or edit_form_advanced hooks
<br />[18:23] &lt;mdawaffe&gt; simple_edit_form
<br />[18:23] &lt;photomatt&gt; interesting
<br />[18:23] &lt;ringmaster&gt; In 1.6, the advanced hook is in the wrong place. &#160;:)
<br />[18:24] &lt;stevecooley&gt; ok, it's not my plugin, and I'm just looking at this from the biz and the user experience perspectives
<br />[18:24] &lt;relle&gt; matt: did you have any new news or anything else before you run off?
<br />[18:24] &lt;stevecooley&gt; thanks for your feedback, folks&#160;:)
<br />[18:25] &lt;photomatt&gt; nope, I think that's it
<br />[18:25] &lt;relle&gt; Sorry for interrupting, just it's getting late and I wanted to make sure.
<br />[18:26] &lt;relle&gt; Ah, one more thing on the list.
<br />[18:26] &lt;relle&gt; Jalenack?
<br />[18:26] &lt;relle&gt; Search Docs plugin
<br />[18:26] &lt;Jalenack&gt; yeah.
<br />[18:26] &lt;Jalenack&gt; Ok, I don't know if you all have tested it, but I think we should publicize it a lot more
<br />[18:27] &lt;ringmaster&gt; I've got the trunk version set up on on redalt.com for download.
<br />[18:27] &lt;relle&gt; link?
<br />[18:27] &lt;ringmaster&gt; There were 202 searches using the plugin during the last week of July.
<br />[18:27] &lt;ringmaster&gt; (Yahoo's API has usage reporting that I didn't know I had access to!)
<br />[18:27] &lt;relle&gt; WOW
<br />[18:27] &lt;Jalenack&gt; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://blog.jalenack.com/archives/codex-search-plugin/">http://blog.jalenack.com/archives/codex-search-plugin/</a>
<br />[18:28] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; I'd just like to say that Jalenack makes us look gooooooood&#160;;P
<br />[18:28] &lt;relle&gt; The plugin is really awesome and fits into the interface beautifully.
<br />[18:29] &lt;Jalenack&gt; too kind&#160;:p
<br />[18:29] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Dude?  Spread the love, I wrote the stinking thing.
<br />[18:29] * relle hugs ringmaster for being so unconditionally giving.
<br />[18:29] &lt;Jalenack&gt; yea!
<br />[18:29] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; Oh, yeah, ringmaster, too...&#160;:P
<br />[18:29] &lt;Jalenack&gt; heh
<br />[18:29] &lt;relle&gt; So we need to speard the word.
<br />[18:29] &lt;relle&gt; spread.
<br />[18:29] &lt;relle&gt; Totally broken fingers today.
<br />[18:29] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Darn right. &#160;;)
<br />[18:30] &lt;Jalenack&gt; sorry, slipped my mind
<br />[18:30] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; We can spear the word, too, relle&#160;:P
<br />[18:30] &lt;relle&gt; that works for me, too.
<br />[18:30] &lt;relle&gt; So everyone talk it up.
<br />[18:30] * tunicwriter runs off to sharpen a rock and find a long stick.
<br />[18:30] &lt;relle&gt; Anything else on the agenda?
<br />[18:30] &lt;Jalenack&gt; well, does the plugin  need any tweaking
<br />[18:30] &lt;Jalenack&gt;&#160;?
<br />[18:30] &lt;relle&gt; And matt thanks for taking time to explain the business side of things.  It answers a LOT of people's questions.
<br />[18:31] &lt;tunicwriter&gt; Yes, indeed...
<br />[18:33] &lt;relle&gt; photomatt?
<br />[18:35] &lt;Firas&gt; i guess &lt;/meetup&gt;&#160;?
<br />[18:35] &lt;relle&gt; thank you
<br />[18:35] * tunicwriter is now known as photomat
<br />[18:35] &lt;relle&gt; Thanks everyone.
<br />[18:35] &lt;photomat&gt; &lt;/meetup&gt;
