May 11 16:04:37 photomatt	still time to add things if there's anything anybody wanted to cover<br />
May 11 16:04:51 photomatt	just a brief catch-up from action items from last week<br />
May 11 16:04:58 photomatt	1.5.1 was released<br />
May 11 16:05:07 ryanduff	yay!<br />
May 11 16:05:10 photomatt	no updates to the logo yet, but I hear *color* might be coming soon<br />
May 11 16:05:20 jonabad	oooooo<br />
May 11 16:05:22 *	westi|gone (~peter@alice.ftwr.co.uk) has joined #wordpress-meetup<br />
May 11 16:05:27 *	westi|gone is now known as westi<br />
May 11 16:05:29 carthik	okay, got my late edit in<br />
May 11 16:05:31 RandyWalker	w00t<br />
May 11 16:05:38 photomatt	haven't gotten to the action items for the forums yet, got caught up with life and release stuff<br />
May 11 16:05:38 westi	evening all<br />
May 11 16:05:41 Pplproof	I had something to add to that, actually.<br />
May 11 16:06:03 photomatt	Pplproof: yes?<br />
May 11 16:06:25 carthik	On the logo, I think this would be an easily reproduced, versatile, short logo&#160;: &lt; WordPress /&gt;<br />
May 11 16:06:30 photomatt	also, didn't sell WordPress to Google this week<br />
May 11 16:06:37 photomatt	though I did look into the wp.com domain from Yahoo<br />
May 11 16:06:39 *	Denis_de (~chatzilla@m57.net195-132-116.noos.fr) has joined #wordpress-meetup<br />
May 11 16:06:46 photomatt	which is *significantly* out of our price range<br />
May 11 16:06:57 skippy	how much?<br />
May 11 16:06:57 RandyWalker	:\<br />
May 11 16:06:59 *	Tyler__ (~Tyler@Kingston-HSE-ppp3558323.sympatico.ca) has joined #wordpress-meetup<br />
May 11 16:07:06 photomatt	1mm+<br />
May 11 16:07:14 westi	ouch<br />
May 11 16:07:15 photomatt	maybe post-IPO<br />
May 11 16:07:15 twistedraisin	dear lord<br />
May 11 16:07:25 Firas	we'll get it one day&#160;:D<br />
May 11 16:07:26 photomatt	however the transfer of wordpress.com is pending<br />
May 11 16:07:28 skippy	pshaw.  for two little lettes?  Not even vowels...<br />
May 11 16:07:37 Blackb|rd	photomatt: mm being what? million $ US?<br />
May 11 16:07:49 Pplproof	Concerning the graphic elements, and being as I've never had a chance to touch base with anyone about it yet, are they something that's open to community contribution? My fianceee and I are both graphic artists by trade, and were looking to come up with some ideas, but weren't sure how long along in the process you were, or if you were open to "outside help".<br />
May 11 16:07:54 photomatt	Blackb|rd: didn't really get to exact figures, the range was already a bit high<br />
May 11 16:08:00 Denis_de	sorry for missing the start but... what is out of price range?<br />
May 11 16:08:03 *	ryanduff|laptop (~ryanduff|@pcp09614033pcs.hershy01.pa.comcast.net) has joined #wordpress-meetup<br />
May 11 16:08:04 *	Heilemann (~Michael@port607.ds1-by.adsl.cybercity.dk) has joined #wordpress-meetup<br />
May 11 16:08:06 Blackb|rd	photomatt: jeez. "too expensive"<br />
May 11 16:08:07 Firas	Denis_de: wp.com domain<br />
May 11 16:08:27 Blackb|rd	Denis_de: price for wp.com. &gt;=1e06 $<br />
May 11 16:08:40 RandyWalker	lol<br />
May 11 16:08:46 *	Jason___ (~TheJason@dhcp80ff6702.dynamic.uiowa.edu) has joined #wordpress-meetup<br />
May 11 16:08:49 *	Denis_de is now known as Semiologic<br />
May 11 16:08:50 photomatt	Pplproof: it's on its fifth iteration or so, so it's getting fairly close to what I think will be the final logo<br />
May 11 16:09:06 MCincubus	photomatt, derivatives of the first logos you showed?<br />
May 11 16:09:07 photomatt	we did have some other community submissions, all of which were quite good<br />
May 11 16:09:10 Semiologic	Blackbird  -- i can imagine&#160;:)<br />
May 11 16:09:12 photomatt	but didn't fit the project as well<br />
May 11 16:09:47 *	ryanduff (~ryan@pcp05146676pcs.reding01.pa.comcast.net) has left #wordpress-meetup<br />
May 11 16:09:52 photomatt	the new logo is going to be more of an evolution rather than a completely new aesthetic<br />
May 11 16:10:00 carthik	photomatt, consider &lt; WordPress /&gt; too, if you will - simple, and in keeping with Semantic, Standards Compliant etc...<br />
May 11 16:10:16 photomatt	carthik: we actually had a submission that did that! maybe I can forward it to you<br />
May 11 16:10:17 masquerade	carthik, note quite, it has uppercases<br />
May 11 16:10:21 Firas	carthik: too geeky.. and chained to xml<br />
May 11 16:10:41 photomatt	what I do hope to be able to do is be able to find uses for the submitted logos, even if they're not the main WP look<br />
May 11 16:10:42 masquerade	s/note/not<br />
May 11 16:10:55 Pplproof	How many entry-level users are really going to "Get" that...?<br />
May 11 16:11:03 twistedraisin	alternate logos for possible prepackaged themes, matt?<br />
May 11 16:11:06 masquerade	photomatt, maybe post them for public display, and let theme authors include one that matches their theme well?<br />
May 11 16:11:12 carthik	like 6A has the 6 dots and the wrench(spanner), more than one could be good. Not everyone has to get it immediately...<br />
May 11 16:11:30 MCincubus	carthik, yeah.  And AOL and the "A" and the "buddy guy"<br />
May 11 16:11:38 photomatt	my fav logos are things like FedEx, with the hidden arrow<br />
May 11 16:11:50 skeltoac	I noticed that very recently<br />
May 11 16:11:58 MCincubus	... I totally never saw that<br />
May 11 16:12:01 Firas	hehe, photomatt wants a WP logo that you can spot on a truck 200ft away&#160;:D<br />
May 11 16:12:09 photomatt	the latest mockup also got a favorable review here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://jefte.net/articles/wordpress-releases-1-5-1-and-logo-previews/">http://jefte.net/articles/wordpress-releases-1-5-1-and-logo-previews/</a><br />
May 11 16:12:15 photomatt	Firas: yes, think billboards and blimps&#160;:)<br />
May 11 16:12:42 Heilemann	Holy crap... There's a hidden arrow in there! Hah! Cool&#160;:D<br />
May 11 16:13:02 photomatt	the next suggested topic was changing the channel, which we already did<br />
May 11 16:13:03 Pplproof	The best logos can used equally effective in B&amp;W, and can be used at ANY size...<br />
May 11 16:13:03 photomatt	so yay!<br />
May 11 16:13:04 relle	Side of an airplane....<br />
May 11 16:13:07 skeltoac	Wait, that's still the latest mockup? Nothing newer?<br />
May 11 16:13:09 skippy	may I ask why the W has a "bulb" on the right end in the logo?  It looks ... odd.<br />
May 11 16:13:12 ryanduff|laptop	c'mon matt, you know you want it changed to "werd press"&#160;:P<br />
May 11 16:13:18 photomatt	skeltoac: nothing since last week<br />
May 11 16:13:19 photomatt	word.<br />
May 11 16:13:43 photomatt	skippy: it symbolizes what big heads we all have<br />
May 11 16:13:52 Firas	yeah, if opinions are counted, the bulb seems out of place<br />
May 11 16:13:55 ColdForged	O_o<br />
May 11 16:13:55 skippy	I didn't think you noticed!<br />
May 11 16:14:07 carthik	word.<br />
May 11 16:14:13 carthik	nice^^<br />
May 11 16:14:23 carthik	move on, though.<br />
May 11 16:14:33 masquerade	I don't necessarily "like" the bulb, but I think if it was removed it would look a little plain<br />
May 11 16:14:42 Firas	Possibility of assigning "positions or areas of responsiblity" for coordindation of the various Codex activities and assignments. Lorelle 22:39, 6 May 2005 (UTC)<br />
May 11 16:14:45 photomatt	as to the next topic, I'm open to more submissions, but probably the best designer time would go toward themes or coordiation with plugin authors<br />
May 11 16:14:50 ryanduff|laptop	it needs something, just not a bulb<br />
May 11 16:14:51 Pplproof	photomatt: If we're moving on, that's a subject I'd like to discuss more in-depth with you, if possible.<br />
May 11 16:15:06 photomatt	Pplproof: not necessary, what did you have in mind?<br />
May 11 16:15:41 Pplproof	Well, I'm just thinking a new user's first impressions to the logo...<br />
May 11 16:15:52 Pplproof	Choice of fonts, for instance.<br />
May 11 16:15:56 *	chuyskywalker (~chuy@64-142-94-171.dsl.static.sonic.net) has joined #wordpress-meetup<br />
May 11 16:16:10 kylev	dude, XML-as-logo is sooooooo 2002!<br />
May 11 16:16:11 Pplproof	Sorry, slipping into "designer" mode here, so bear with me...&#160;;)<br />
May 11 16:16:40 Pplproof	What sort of attitude are you trying to convey with it?<br />
May 11 16:16:57 Pplproof	"professional", "forward thinking", "progressive"...?<br />
May 11 16:16:58 photomatt	well if you look at logos in general<br />
May 11 16:17:08 photomatt	and logos of other companies/products in our space<br />
May 11 16:17:12 Blackb|rd	as fort the bulby W: it may become the "Wordpress W" which i turn makes it easy to have really tiny logos signifying WP stuff.<br />
May 11 16:17:16 photomatt	on one end you have blogger, ultra friendly<br />
May 11 16:17:20 photomatt	Blackb|rd: exactly<br />
May 11 16:17:28 *	Heilemann has quit ()<br />
May 11 16:17:30 photomatt	but Blogger is also a little comic-booky<br />
May 11 16:17:37 photomatt	they're like the Kia<br />
May 11 16:17:45 photomatt	we want to be the Lexus/Mercedes of blogging<br />
May 11 16:17:48 MCincubus	"Hey kids!!"<br />
May 11 16:17:50 Pplproof	Yes, they're designed to be ULTRA-accessible.<br />
May 11 16:18:02 photomatt	which I think is a good contrast to how FREE we are<br />
May 11 16:18:04 relle	photomatt: then the logo is perfect. The bulb in the middle looks like a car logo.<br />
May 11 16:18:06 Pplproof	You want to be the Lexus that still gets 50MPG...?<br />
May 11 16:18:09 masquerade	without the price<br />
May 11 16:18:40 Blackb|rd	and having decent typography also adds to a feeling of sophistication.<br />
May 11 16:18:42 photomatt	free but priceless<br />
May 11 16:18:48 MCincubus	The free Lexus that is yours to drive, if you don't mind a manual transmission.<br />
May 11 16:18:50 factoryjoe	photomatt: have you thought about the license on the font at all?<br />
May 11 16:19:08 factoryjoe	on problem with spreadfirefox was that everyone wants the FF Meta font...<br />
May 11 16:19:18 factoryjoe	which, b/c of copyright, we couldn't just give away...<br />
May 11 16:19:22 photomatt	factoryjoe: I'll probably end up buying it, I think it's &lt; $30<br />
May 11 16:19:23 factoryjoe	mrs eaves is copyrighted<br />
May 11 16:19:23 *	h3h (prb@cpe-24-165-8-156.san.res.rr.com) has joined #wordpress-meetup<br />
May 11 16:19:33 factoryjoe	yeah, that's for your *your* license<br />
May 11 16:19:40 relle	he's right.<br />
May 11 16:19:42 Firas	oh i recognize factoryjoe<br />
May 11 16:19:42 photomatt	we could certainly distribute vectors of the logo<br />
May 11 16:19:48 factoryjoe	by comparison, the drupal font is open source<br />
May 11 16:19:50 photomatt	without sending out the whole font<br />
May 11 16:19:51 Blackb|rd	photomatt: I think he meant for the countless ppl who want do acfepress T-Shirts<br />
May 11 16:19:56 MCincubus	yeah. you can't copyright fonts.  Only the font files, I think.<br />
May 11 16:19:58 factoryjoe	photomatt: that's one option<br />
May 11 16:20:14 photomatt	after this is done I want so much schwag no one will know what to do<br />
May 11 16:20:16 factoryjoe	just wanted to make a note of that...<br />
May 11 16:20:19 carthik	photomatt, that would be nice and maybe even necessary<br />
May 11 16:20:27 skeltoac	shwag =&gt; ditto<br />
May 11 16:20:27 photomatt	not cafepress, maybe real shirts<br />
May 11 16:20:28 skippy	I didn't mean to hang us up on the bulb.  It just seems incongruently curvy on an otherwise rigid serif character.<br />
May 11 16:20:39 Blackb|rd	photomatt: 'course, but you got what I meant<br />
May 11 16:20:51 relle	skippy: that's the contrast effect - it's a good thing.<br />
May 11 16:21:00 photomatt	speaking of shirts<br />
May 11 16:21:02 *	westi wants shwag too<br />
May 11 16:21:07 Pplproof	I have to agree with skippy on this.<br />
May 11 16:21:08 Blackb|rd	skippy: well, WP makes a difference, doesn't it?<br />
May 11 16:21:12 skippy	it strikes me as discordant, more than contrast.<br />
May 11 16:21:20 photomatt	we got an email a few days ago from <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.spreadshirt.com/">http://www.spreadshirt.com/</a><br />
May 11 16:21:24 factoryjoe	i'm w/ skippy... <br />
May 11 16:21:25 photomatt	they want to promote themselves to bloggers<br />
May 11 16:21:27 h3h	where's the new logo?<br />
May 11 16:21:27 factoryjoe	what??!<br />
May 11 16:21:37 Blackb|rd	could be a smaller bulb, agreed.<br />
May 11 16:21:41 MCincubus	h3h, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://photomatt.net/temp/">http://photomatt.net/temp/</a><br />
May 11 16:21:56 relle	photomatt: I personally (experienced voice here) like it.  I didn't at first, but I see the potential.  Bulb alone, words alone, all together, t-shirts, swatches, billboards - blogs, blogrolls, lots of versatility.  Good work.  Remember, a lot of work goes into these things, folks.  And a lot of thought.<br />
May 11 16:21:57 Blackb|rd	photomatt: German Co., IIRC<br />
May 11 16:22:03 h3h	hmm. what's the significance of the bulb?<br />
May 11 16:22:05 skeltoac	Shrink that bulb too much, Blackb|rd, and you lose the distinctiveness that it needs.<br />
May 11 16:22:06 photomatt	please don't link to that URL in blogs, that is a temporary spot<br />

May 11 16:22:33 *	Topic for #wordpress-meetup is: WordPress Weekly IRC Meetup | Wednesdays at 5PM EST<br />
May 11 16:22:33 *	Topic for #wordpress-meetup set by masq|coding at Wed May 11 14:37:02 2005<br />
May 11 16:22:41 Blackb|rd	skippy: a complicated balance, agreed<br />
May 11 16:22:48 carthik	well what about spreadshirt, though, matt?<br />
May 11 16:22:51 photomatt	Opera uses spreadshirt for their US and EU stores<br />
May 11 16:22:55 Pplproof	The logo does a nice job of carrying that "professional" vibe, but it doesn't come across as very "accessible"... Serif fonts = Law firms, "elitist", etc.<br />
May 11 16:23:14 Pplproof	And it doesn't really have the distinction to stick in my mind.<br />
May 11 16:23:22 photomatt	and falls back to cafepress for other items<br />
May 11 16:23:24 chuyskywalker	wp_logo_4.00.gif -- makes me think of aviation for some reason. Wings, etc. <br />
May 11 16:23:25 westi	from my experiences in doing t-shirts (I organised halls t-shirts at uni two years running) there pricing is reasonable too<br />
May 11 16:23:36 photomatt	westi: that's good to know<br />
May 11 16:23:54 Semiologic	personally i like the current logo. why in the world do we want to change it?<br />
May 11 16:23:59 skippy	how much are speradshirt shirts?<br />
May 11 16:24:05 westi	from memory for screen printing resale of 8-10 a tshirt is a good price<br />
May 11 16:24:06 h3h	are colors being considered for the new logo at all?<br />
May 11 16:24:09 skeltoac	Semio, not iconic enough.<br />
May 11 16:24:19 photomatt	I'm going to see if we can get a sample from them, if the quality looks good perhaps we can give them a spot on the forums for a month in exchange for a deal on shirts<br />
May 11 16:24:23 westi	skippy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.spreadshirt.com/Products_and_Printin.17.0.html">http://www.spreadshirt.com/Products_and_Printin.17.0.html</a><br />
May 11 16:24:31 Blackb|rd	Pplproof: well, it's hard to both convey free (libre) and high-quality<br />
May 11 16:24:39 photomatt	h3h: haven't gotten to colors yet, just making it work in B/W first<br />
May 11 16:24:45 h3h	got it<br />
May 11 16:24:47 carthik	photomatt, I hope they do not end up having a monopoly though.<br />
May 11 16:24:49 *	citizenjim has quit ()<br />
May 11 16:24:58 photomatt	carthik: who?<br />
May 11 16:25:01 carthik	photomatt, what will be usage restrictions on the logo/brand be?<br />
May 11 16:25:05 Firas	Is WP going to be trademarked?<br />
May 11 16:25:06 *	h3h votes for the one on the top in 4.01<br />
May 11 16:25:07 carthik	photomatt, spreadshirt<br />
May 11 16:25:29 Pplproof	Blackb|rd: Not necessarily... There's still a difference between high-quality, and "elitist". You can still have something that's "sophisticated", etc.<br />
May 11 16:25:36 photomatt	"WordPress" is being trademarked, yes<br />
May 11 16:25:47 photomatt	it needs to be for protection, as wordpress.com showed us<br />
May 11 16:25:49 Firas	which might create another problem that firefox is dealing with<br />
May 11 16:25:56 Blackb|rd	Pplproof: but it gets exceedingly difficult (not argueing: it's what we should aim for, but it's hard to do)<br />
May 11 16:25:57 Firas	yeah, i agree, it should be<br />
May 11 16:26:03 factoryjoe	yeah it's a tough nut to crack<br />
May 11 16:26:12 factoryjoe	(licensing that is)<br />
May 11 16:26:16 Pplproof	Blackb|rd: I certainly agree... But that's what I get paid to do.&#160;;)<br />
May 11 16:26:30 Blackb|rd	Pplproof: then do it already!&#160;;))<br />
May 11 16:26:42 Pplproof	Blackb|rd: That's why I was asking Matt!&#160;;D<br />
May 11 16:26:43 Pplproof	lol<br />
May 11 16:26:45 factoryjoe	photomatt: i started a conversation w/ the creative commons guys about doing to trademark what they've done for copyright<br />
May 11 16:26:53 MCincubus	Yeah... if it's not going to even be considered, it's not worth his time.<br />
May 11 16:26:54 factoryjoe	glenn over there is v. interested<br />
May 11 16:27:04 Firas	that's very interesting<br />
May 11 16:27:07 photomatt	factoryjoe: that could be interesting<br />
May 11 16:27:10 factoryjoe	yes<br />
May 11 16:27:17 Blackb|rd	photomatt: I have to second Pplproof in that volunteer pros might have a few ideas that this large circle of poeple might overlook.<br />
May 11 16:27:17 photomatt	the current "stance" is<br />
May 11 16:27:19 factoryjoe	me and steven garrity brought it up last fall<br />
May 11 16:27:26 factoryjoe	when we first started having problems on SFX<br />
May 11 16:27:40 photomatt	don't use "wordpress" in your domain or site name, everything else is fair<br />
May 11 16:27:54 factoryjoe	that's the problem...<br />
May 11 16:27:57 factoryjoe	you can't just say that<br />
May 11 16:28:07 factoryjoe	the law doesn't allow you to if you're going to "protect it"<br />
May 11 16:28:11 photomatt	I know<br />
May 11 16:28:12 Pplproof	Identity-related matters are rarely (not to shut everyone out, just stating a fact I've dealt with before) something that are handled effectively by a committee.<br />
May 11 16:28:12 factoryjoe	hence we need an alternative<br />
May 11 16:29:07 Blackb|rd	Pplproof: I have the vision that WP might want to be to Blogging what LaTeX is to papers/articles in academia.<br />
May 11 16:29:16 factoryjoe	in any case, this is real issue to consider sooner than later as you move fwd w/ trademark<br />
May 11 16:29:26 factoryjoe	roping the CC guys in now would be smart I think<br />
May 11 16:29:29 photomatt	I think that's good for this week w/r/t identity, let's talk about it again next week though<br />
May 11 16:29:33 factoryjoe	I can do intros if you want...<br />
May 11 16:29:46 Blackb|rd	photomatt: ack. let's move on.<br />
May 11 16:29:49 factoryjoe	just lemme know<br />
May 11 16:30:14 Firas	i'm nobody but i'd recommend that photomatt and cc hookup in this trademark issue&#160;:D<br />
May 11 16:30:22 MCincubus	I move that we move to 1.5.1 =&gt; 1.5.2 discussion.<br />
May 11 16:30:30 twistedraisin	not true, firas, your plugin kicks ass.<br />
May 11 16:30:31 photomatt	Firas: I'll follow up on that<br />
May 11 16:30:33 masquerade	Firas, that's what factoryjoe was recommending<br />
May 11 16:30:35 photomatt	MCincubus: let's save that for last<br />
May 11 16:30:36 skippy	I second MCincubus <br />
May 11 16:30:44 skippy	darn<br />
May 11 16:30:48 skippy	too slow.<br />
May 11 16:31:02 RandyWalker	lol<br />
May 11 16:31:06 Firas	ok, want next codex item now?<br />
May 11 16:31:07 photomatt	maybe the topic by Lorelle now<br />
May 11 16:31:08 photomatt	is she here?<br />
May 11 16:31:15 relle	here<br />
May 11 16:31:28 RandyWalker	no Lo&#160;?<br />
May 11 16:31:29 RandyWalker	:)<br />
May 11 16:31:35 relle	Possibility of assigning "positions or areas of responsiblity" for coordindation of the various Codex activities and assignments.<br />
May 11 16:31:38 photomatt	relle: What did you have in mind?<br />
May 11 16:31:40 relle	no lo&#160;;-)<br />
May 11 16:31:46 RandyWalker	:-D<br />
May 11 16:32:13 photomatt	more specifically, what responsibilities do you think need assigning<br />
May 11 16:32:16 relle	The Codex is really tightening up and I'd like to see some responsiblity assigned to volunteers to coordinate efforts.<br />
May 11 16:32:28 relle	After the name of the admin, I'd like to see areas of responsibility.<br />
May 11 16:32:38 twistedraisin	what do you need the volunteers to do?<br />
May 11 16:32:50 relle	So if someone comes in and is a plugin expert, I would know to send them to X who is in charge of plugin information on the codex.<br />
May 11 16:33:02 relle	If someone wants to help with Lessons, they would know that this is my baby.<br />
May 11 16:33:05 ryanduff|laptop	who let RandyWalker in here&#160;:P<br />
May 11 16:33:05 RandyWalker	relle: are you saying, like "So and so: you're in charge of Templating, Whatshisname is in charge of Installation" etc?<br />
May 11 16:33:13 relle	Something like that.<br />
May 11 16:33:16 RandyWalker	ryanduff|laptop: I've been in here&#160;:P<br />
May 11 16:33:31 relle	A lot of people come in and say I want to help, I'm good at X and then they are ignored.<br />
May 11 16:33:31 photomatt	I don't know if the docs team is big enough for that<br />
May 11 16:33:53 relle	Why not?<br />
May 11 16:33:56 skippy	at a high-level, I think it would work.<br />
May 11 16:34:04 Semiologic	relle: i think a better approach would be to simply making it more obvious who is maintaining the codex<br />
May 11 16:34:08 relle	Already people like macmanx handle themes and plugins - so why not say so on the list.<br />
May 11 16:34:20 relle	Obvious is good and that is in the works.<br />
May 11 16:34:23 Semiologic	and to list where contributors write<br />
May 11 16:34:30 relle	BINGO!<br />
May 11 16:34:37 relle	They are just a list of names.<br />
May 11 16:34:56 *	ColdForged (~ColdForge@cpe-024-211-175-171.nc.res.rr.com) has left #wordpress-meetup<br />
May 11 16:35:01 photomatt	this list? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Special:Listadmins">http://codex.wordpress.org/Special:Listadmins</a><br />
May 11 16:35:02 Semiologic	if you say so: i wouldn't even know where to find the said list in the codex<br />
May 11 16:35:04 photomatt	that page isn't editable<br />
May 11 16:35:05 carthik	I think the way it works now is fine: we have a few SysOps admins, clearly listed, and I just edited the few pages introducing the Codex to new volunteers that those are the people to contact in case of confusion, as also sending a mail to the wp-docs list.<br />
May 11 16:35:33 relle	The new <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks">http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks</a> Task List Carthik and I put together is ready and waiting for people to sign up and get involved and I'd like to see people help direct the efforts.<br />
May 11 16:35:40 *	Amazon (~kieran@h-67-100-116-146.snvacaid.covad.net) has joined #wordpress-meetup<br />
May 11 16:36:19 photomatt	I think we have a overuse of the stubs like {{Copyedit}}<br />
May 11 16:36:20 relle	photomatt: yes, that list or something like it.<br />
May 11 16:36:32 *	chrisjdavis has quit ()<br />
May 11 16:36:32 photomatt	if those were more judiciously applied perhaps they could be used more to direct efforts<br />
May 11 16:36:37 twistedraisin	I don't mind volunteering, I just haven't been sure where my effort is needed as of yet.<br />
May 11 16:36:44 ringmaster	Well if people would actually *Edit Copy* that wouldn't be an issue...<br />
May 11 16:37:00 relle	twistedraisin, that's a great example of what I'm getting at.<br />
May 11 16:37:05 carthik	photomatt, the page you linked to has a template that can be edited, to add leading text, before the list itself.<br />
May 11 16:37:23 relle	If people know that Lorelle is in charge of Lessons - then they could leave a message on my user page and I could direct their energies.<br />
May 11 16:37:46 skippy	relle: your user page was intimidatingly cluttered last time I looked at it.<br />
May 11 16:37:52 relle	I'm not talking about corporate bureacracy here, just some info.<br />
May 11 16:37:55 skippy	I wasn't sure leaving you a message would produce meaningful results.<br />
May 11 16:38:07 relle	Hit the discussion page to leave a message.<br />
May 11 16:38:07 photomatt	maybe if the <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="../../../index.html">http://codex.wordpress.org</a> CodexContributing page could have a better call to action<br />
May 11 16:38:08 Firas	i almost just suggested that the codex should have a wiki<br />
May 11 16:38:18 RandyWalker	Firas: uhhh<br />
May 11 16:38:19 photomatt	discussion should probably *mostly* happen over the docs list<br />
May 11 16:38:23 westi	Firas: but that wiki would need a codex!<br />
May 11 16:38:27 photomatt	as following discussion on the wiki is horrid<br />
May 11 16:38:35 relle	It puts a big YOU HAVE MESSAGES on the site when I visit.  Always post messages in the User discussion area.<br />
May 11 16:38:39 carthik	photomatt, I am open to improving that page, however it's possible.<br />
May 11 16:38:41 masquerade	While on the wiki, why not set it as a redirect to the codex?<br />
May 11 16:39:03 relle	photomatt, the Contributing page has been totally redone in the past few days by Carthik and it's MUCH better.<br />
May 11 16:39:05 MCincubus	There is some really old 1.2 stuff on wiki that could actually be doing harm.<br />
May 11 16:39:16 photomatt	on wiki.wordpress.org?<br />
May 11 16:39:20 relle	Yes.<br />
May 11 16:39:24 *	MCincubus nods<br />
May 11 16:39:27 photomatt	ideally the relevant articles should redirect to the new wiki<br />
May 11 16:39:34 photomatt	phpwiki supports external redirects<br />
May 11 16:39:35 carthik	photomatt, on the subject of {{Templates}} I made a list at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Maintenance">http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Maintenance</a> which are the ones intended for use, and none else. I think the set is optimal for use<br />
May 11 16:39:38 relle	Some great stuff that is still in the works to be moved to the new Codex, but harmful stuff too.<br />
May 11 16:39:59 skippy	relle: I was speaking about your discussion page.  It's so full that I wasn't sure _my_ discussion would generate any activity, and would be lost in the shuffle.<br />
May 11 16:40:16 photomatt	relle: perhaps the task for the next few weeks could be transitioning the old wiki more finally<br />
May 11 16:40:18 relle	Skippy, just add a note to the bottom.  I'll look at cleaning it up later.<br />
May 11 16:40:23 carthik	skippy, relle, I move old discussions into sub pages of my Talk page - might help<br />
May 11 16:40:26 relle	Sure.<br />
May 11 16:40:28 masquerade	I'd recommend setting wiki.wordpress.org to point to the codex, and have a special subdomain where the docs team could get to the wiki to transfer new information older<br />
May 11 16:40:48 skippy	carthik: good idea.  *I* know how it works, but a new contributor might feel even more overwhelmed than me.<br />
May 11 16:40:54 photomatt	masquerade: there are still lots of links to pages there, the pages themselves should redirect, not the whole subdomain<br />
May 11 16:41:56 photomatt	relle: would you like to be the person who assigns incoming <strike>victims</strike> volunteers to the codex?<br />
May 11 16:42:18 relle	Hmmmm.<br />
May 11 16:42:33 relle	I'll think about it.<br />
May 11 16:42:49 MCincubus	<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="../../../Put_me_in_coach.html">http://codex.wordpress.org/Put_me_in_coach</a>&#160;;-)<br />
May 11 16:43:05 RandyWalker	I want to work on the Codex too<br />
May 11 16:43:11 relle	I think that anyone could push someone towards an area IF THEY KNEW WHO DID WHAT.<br />
May 11 16:43:25 carthik	RandyWalker, did you really that just now?&#160;;)<br />
May 11 16:43:47 Firas	relle: start a page on the community area?<br />
May 11 16:43:54 Firas	where people can sign up to be topic leaders<br />
May 11 16:43:58 relle	RandyWalker: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Community_Portal">http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Community_Portal</a><br />
May 11 16:44:01 Firas	who you can get in touch with<br />
May 11 16:44:02 photomatt	relle: people can put their interests on their forum profile<br />
May 11 16:44:03 carthik	relle, but basically, what is the need for such specialization, considering the volunteer nature of the effort and all.<br />
May 11 16:44:06 RandyWalker	carthik had me working on some stuff a while ago. but the codex is kinda overwhelming. I need specifics on wat to do..<br />
May 11 16:44:10 RandyWalker	carthik: eh?<br />
May 11 16:44:19 relle	Directed effort.<br />
May 11 16:44:35 relle	Randy and twistedraisin gave good examples:  I want to help but I don't know what to do.<br />
May 11 16:44:43 carthik	RandyWalker, the Codex:Contributing page defines things you can do, almost all the things, in a hopefully simple straight fashion<br />
May 11 16:44:44 relle	I don't know who to turn to.  I don't know where to go.  Who to ask.<br />
May 11 16:45:02 RandyWalker	these pages are hard to find...<br />
May 11 16:45:04 photomatt	relle: would the docs list be a good place to start?<br />
May 11 16:45:14 relle	Sure.<br />
May 11 16:45:21 relle	This is what I would do if I were in charge of the world.<br />
May 11 16:45:25 carthik	relle, consider this, there is no list about which dev is responsible for what part of WP's code, for one.<br />
May 11 16:45:32 relle	Make a list of the areas covered by who.<br />
May 11 16:45:32 photomatt	relle: perhaps with shorter, more direct messages. before I've had trouble with the length of what you were writing, personally&#160;:)<br />
May 11 16:46:01 relle	Then if you find someone with an interest, shove them towards that person.<br />
May 11 16:46:09 twistedraisin	relle: Well I signed up for something minor for now<br />
May 11 16:46:11 relle	What messages?<br />
May 11 16:46:14 carthik	...who might be busy, relle&#160;:)<br />
May 11 16:46:16 relle	Thanks.  Great.<br />
May 11 16:46:38 photomatt	well I think an interests page would be a good idea<br />
May 11 16:46:41 Semiologic	Lorelle: why can't this be a heat map?<br />
May 11 16:46:49 relle	What be a heat map?<br />
May 11 16:46:54 photomatt	lik relle suggested, let people put their name and their expertise<br />
May 11 16:47:03 factoryjoe	sounds like 43things<br />
May 11 16:47:05 photomatt	and then anyone can route. is that the idea?<br />
May 11 16:47:09 photomatt	factoryjoe: damn hippie<br />
May 11 16:47:10 Semiologic	for instance, you could use the existing 'categories' as tags, and draw a heat map of where contributors write<br />
May 11 16:47:13 relle	YES!<br />
May 11 16:47:13 factoryjoe	haha<br />
May 11 16:47:32 relle	Heat map = clutter.<br />
May 11 16:47:35 Firas	you'd need to keep track of that though<br />
May 11 16:47:41 carthik	oh please don't talking about mediawiki hacking, now&#160;:)<br />
May 11 16:47:43 Firas	mediawiki is not something that can be easily hacked into is it<br />
May 11 16:47:48 Semiologic	the only thing that would be required would be to tag pages some bit<br />
May 11 16:47:50 Firas	carthik: jinx&#160;:)<br />
May 11 16:47:56 factoryjoe	<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://flickr.com/photos/factoryjoe/11118526/in/set-272946/">http://flickr.com/photos/factoryjoe/11118526/in/set-272946/</a><br />
May 11 16:48:08 Semiologic	speaking of mediawiki -- why isn't the codex running wordpress?&#160;:)<br />
May 11 16:48:18 relle	OKay, so carthik and I will work on a list asking people to list their interest and involvement in the Codex for others to seek out.<br />
May 11 16:48:28 Firas	'coz WP isn't the best tool for a wiki?<br />
May 11 16:48:31 masquerade	Quick suggestion: anyone care to extend the meeting, as there are quite a few more topics that I doubt can be covered in 10 minutes<br />
May 11 16:48:32 carthik	Semiologic, WordPress is not a collaborative editing tool.<br />
May 11 16:48:43 jonabad	i second masquerade<br />
May 11 16:48:51 twistedraisin	Semiologic: wordpress is a blogging, not wiki, tool<br />
May 11 16:49:02 carthik	relle, we both can't - each person will have to speak for themselves, pretty much.<br />
May 11 16:49:36 relle	"I" will work on a list that will INVITE people to sign up with their interst and involvement in the Codex.<br />
May 11 16:49:37 Firas	if we need to keep time deadlines then we need a secretary-type or something to move us along (even photomatt), if not the meeting should just keep going until it exhausts...<br />
May 11 16:50:08 relle	That should help direct people to who does what and to find out how to help.<br />
May 11 16:50:10 Semiologic	carthik: i find it amazingly rich so far, as a cms. wiki is just a few steps away<br />
May 11 16:50:11 *	Falo (~SMILE@84-72-89-182.dclient.hispeed.ch) has joined #wordpress-meetup<br />
May 11 16:50:24 Pplproof	I used to take parlimentary procedure in high school and college, but I refuse.<br />
May 11 16:50:25 Pplproof	;P<br />
May 11 16:50:26 Pplproof	lol<br />
May 11 16:50:29 masquerade	I agree with Firas, and I know that it was previously mentioned to be ending at 5, which is hardly long enough apparently<br />
May 11 16:50:34 carthik	Semiologic, evolve till you check mail (old joke, I know)&#160;:)<br />
May 11 16:50:43 relle	I'm done.<br />
May 11 16:50:58 photomatt	masquerade: I think we could add 30 minutes and cover everything<br />
May 11 16:51:02 twistedraisin	thanks for your input, relle.<br />
May 11 16:51:06 *	RandyWalker knows parli-pro.<br />
May 11 16:51:22 relle	NEXT?<br />
May 11 16:51:31 *	mdawaffe (~mdawaffe@66-215-80-17.pas-dcbi.charterpipeline.net) has joined #wordpress-meetup<br />
May 11 16:51:38 photomatt	relle: alright, send a link to that page to wp-docs when it's up&#160;:)<br />
May 11 16:51:42 carthik	'ola mdawaffe <br />
May 11 16:51:45 relle	I will, don't worry.<br />
May 11 16:51:50 mdawaffe	hey carthik <br />
May 11 16:51:53 *	skippy has quit ("Free as in Puppies!")<br />
May 11 16:52:00 Firas	 Timeline for an RSS Patch/1.5.2 (jonabad)<br />
May 11 16:52:51 twistedraisin	Ryan was nailing down patch stuff for RSS today, I think. Matt had mentioned a few other things worth taking care of before the next dot release went out<br />
May 11 16:52:53 photomatt	the plan is to get the confirmed patches in the source ASAP<br />
May 11 16:52:54 MCincubus	Also,   Any other things that should be fit into 1.5.2 release? --MCincubus<br />
May 11 16:53:01 photomatt	MCincubus: I'd say no<br />
May 11 16:53:29 photomatt	I think getting the fixes out sooner is more important<br />
May 11 16:53:54 mikelittle	What about the SQL errors here? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://mosquito.wordpress.org/view.php?id=1331">http://mosquito.wordpress.org/view.php?id=1331</a> <br />
May 11 16:53:59 *	westi agrees getting out a bug fix only release soon is important<br />
May 11 16:54:06 jonabad	photomatt, superfast like this weekend?<br />
May 11 16:54:07 MCincubus	What's the deal with the Ping-O-Matic problems people have been complaining about?<br />
May 11 16:54:10 photomatt	mikelittle: that's fine<br />
May 11 16:54:47 MCincubus	Unable to ping Ping-o-Matic  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://mosquito.wordpress.org/view.php?id=1325">http://mosquito.wordpress.org/view.php?id=1325</a><br />
May 11 16:54:58 photomatt	MCincubus: I believe it has to do with extended pings<br />
May 11 16:55:31 MCincubus	worth fixing or not?<br />
May 11 16:55:43 MCincubus	for 1.5.2, I mean.<br />
May 11 16:55:45 photomatt	MCincubus: already fixed<br />
May 11 16:55:53 photomatt	it was a prob in PoM, not WP<br />
May 11 16:56:15 MCincubus	Oh cool... then that bug can be closed.<br />
May 11 16:56:39 photomatt	done<br />
May 11 16:56:49 twistedraisin	1324,1325,1331, 1323, how about the paging bug, we can nail that one into 1.5.2 right?<br />
May 11 16:56:50 mikelittle	Matt has wordpress.org just died? Getting access refused<br />
May 11 16:56:50 MCincubus	RSS stuff is just a rollback?<br />
May 11 16:57:01 photomatt	no, the problem was the rollback<br />
May 11 16:57:03 twistedraisin	ryan schlogged that one down today I think.<br />
May 11 16:57:05 relle	mikelittle: no.<br />
May 11 16:57:10 photomatt	it's a change in the rolled-back logic<br />
May 11 16:57:10 relle	I'm on it and it's fine.<br />
May 11 16:57:11 *	ringmaster|home (~ringmaste@pool-68-238-242-50.phlapa.fios.verizon.net) has joined #wordpress-meetup<br />
May 11 16:57:20 masquerade	anyone know if skippy submitted the bug report on plugin hooks and posting?<br />
May 11 16:57:22 photomatt	have no problem getting to wordpress.org here<br />
May 11 16:57:25 MCincubus	masquerade, he did<br />
May 11 16:57:34 *	masquerade thinks that should be fixed in 1.5.2<br />
May 11 16:57:49 twistedraisin	gotta catch a train, later.<br />
May 11 16:57:49 ryanduff|laptop	mikelittle: no peoblems here<br />
May 11 16:57:54 *	twistedraisin is now known as Provos|T<br />
May 11 16:57:59 MCincubus	Would be nice... especially since it enables Skippy's plugin to do future-dated pings!<br />
May 11 16:58:02 photomatt	okay people chill<br />
May 11 16:58:03 ryanduff|laptop	ringmaster|home: welcome<br />
May 11 16:58:14 photomatt	there aren't two bugs that will be fixed<br />
May 11 16:58:29 ringmaster|home	Hello ryan!  Hello again, work self!<br />
May 11 16:58:35 mikelittle	my bad. firewall/web cache died!<br />
May 11 16:58:39 photomatt	if it's in the bug tracker and isn't a feature, and can be fixed soon, then it should work in 1.5.2<br />
May 11 16:59:22 photomatt	mostly we need testing and more reporting<br />
May 11 16:59:52 ringmaster|home	I think a major part of the problem with the 1.5.1 release is that there weren't enough testers.<br />
May 11 16:59:54 photomatt	the one thing I'm not sure about is the reported pingback/trackback problems by people like macmanx<br />
May 11 17:00:07 photomatt	ringmaster: I don't think there's enough variety of testers<br />
May 11 17:00:15 ringmaster|home	On this, I also agree.<br />
May 11 17:00:23 photomatt	the pb/tb problem is so sporadic I have no idea what it could be, could be his host<br />
May 11 17:00:24 *	h3h recommends <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://mosquito.wordpress.org/view.php?id=1306">http://mosquito.wordpress.org/view.php?id=1306</a> for 1.5.2 (simple fix)<br />
May 11 17:00:37 photomatt	ringmaster: I saw you did a pb/tb tester, any results from that?<br />
May 11 17:00:52 RandyWalker	ok, I'm going to shit, shower, and shave&#160;:)<br />
May 11 17:00:56 RandyWalker	this was fun<br />
May 11 17:01:02 RandyWalker	ta ta&#160;:)<br />
May 11 17:01:05 ringmaster|home	Well, I didn't try it on his site, but I tried pingin his site from mine today, and it didn't work.<br />
May 11 17:01:16 RandyWalker	(you can remove that from the transcripts if you want)<br />
May 11 17:01:19 *	RandyWalker (~randy@207.72.44.28) has left #wordpress-meetup<br />
May 11 17:01:30 MCincubus	could it be that he doesn't have URL fopen or CURL?<br />
May 11 17:01:34 photomatt	I think macmanx just has a funky host or something, if we can identify anything broader that would help<br />
May 11 17:01:44 photomatt	he's on BlueHost, which was recently removed from the hosting page<br />
May 11 17:01:59 photomatt	MCincubus: no because I was able to send him a pingback yesterday<br />
May 11 17:02:46 ringmaster|home	Maybe a firewall issue?  Or perhaps the script times out?  Any number of crazy things could be the culprit.<br />
May 11 17:03:29 skeltoac	CURL is often thwarted by the host's proxy. GoDaddy had one and their tech support couldn't help me get through it.<br />
May 11 17:03:54 skeltoac	In the end I upgraded my account just to enable fsockopen.<br />
May 11 17:03:59 photomatt	people on godaddy hosting are almost hopeless<br />
May 11 17:04:39 skeltoac	I'm on a month-to-month basis with them until I can afford better.<br />
May 11 17:04:46 michel_v	perhaps we could have some way to make pingback not check for accuracy and excerpt<br />
May 11 17:04:55 michel_v	and instead place the pingback in moderation queue<br />
May 11 17:05:11 MCincubus	hm... so... fopen, CURL, moderation?<br />
May 11 17:05:13 photomatt	michel_v: they go in moderation queues anyway, and I would rather not open it up to spam like trackback<br />
May 11 17:06:07 ringmaster|home	Much of the problem is that these features are too transparent to debug.  Most of it takes place after post.php kicks the user back out to the editing page.<br />
May 11 17:06:41 photomatt	which is on purpose, because they can be slow<br />
May 11 17:06:57 ringmaster|home	Yes.  Although a constant that turns that off would be *superb*.<br />
May 11 17:07:00 photomatt	ideally we could do them in an iframe or similar after reload and show status<br />
May 11 17:07:36 westi	photomatt: iframe... nah you want AJAX&#160;;)<br />
May 11 17:07:53 ryanduff|laptop	westi: I was just about to say that<br />
May 11 17:08:05 photomatt	all the same. google maps uses iframes to communicate with the server<br />
May 11 17:08:35 Firas	is JS a requirement to successfully admin? (i don't care either way, just checking)<br />
May 11 17:08:43 photomatt	okay, how about internationalized support now?<br />
May 11 17:08:45 photomatt	Firas: nope<br />
May 11 17:08:50 ringmaster|home	Something that shows the status of the pings/trackback after the page reloads would be very user-friendly.<br />
May 11 17:09:00 westi	you can do some cool stuff with auto refreshing IFRAMEs and some simple JS<br />
May 11 17:09:15 h3h	photomatt: note that iframes add an item to the user's history, so pressing the Back button would bring about a seemingly undesired result. food for though.<br />
May 11 17:09:18 h3h	thought.<br />
May 11 17:09:36 westi	h3h: do they.. i've not seen that<br />
May 11 17:09:40 photomatt	h3h: the point was how it's implemented isn't important, just the idea<br />
May 11 17:09:54 h3h	i know&#160;:) just ensuring clarity going in.<br />
May 11 17:09:54 photomatt	neuro`: did you want to say something about internationalization?<br />
May 11 17:10:36 ringmaster|home	What's the bid deal with i18n, then?<br />
May 11 17:10:51 ringmaster|home	s/bid/big<br />
May 11 17:10:59 h3h	westi: aye. see [ <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://beta.xkr.us/js-iframe-location.html">http://beta.xkr.us/js-iframe-location.html</a> ]. click on any link in the frame, then click your back button.<br />
May 11 17:12:02 Firas	is neuro` there?<br />
May 11 17:12:06 westi	h3h: i would say that is correct behaviour<br />
May 11 17:12:11 Firas	or we can just move it to next meeting<br />
May 11 17:12:21 photomatt	ringmaster: not sure what neuro` wanted to bring up, let's put it off for now<br />
May 11 17:12:32 ringmaster|home	Ok. &#160;:)<br />
May 11 17:12:41 h3h	westi: agreed. the point was to beware of that behavior if one is to use a hidden iframe to accomplish a task such as monitoring [ping|track]backs.<br />
May 11 17:12:54 photomatt	eventually there will be i18n version of the wordpress.org website itself on subdomains, but that project needs some work<br />
May 11 17:13:39 carthik	so what's next?<br />
May 11 17:13:40 Firas	 Conclude the professional support discussion started earlier (Carthik)<br />
May 11 17:13:48 photomatt	need some sort of content management system that can have a set structure and show english/translation side-by-side for the translators<br />
May 11 17:14:13 carthik	oh, d'oh, Firas...<br />
May 11 17:14:20 Firas	i'm making something like rosetta so if there's anything specific i can put into matt let me know<br />
May 11 17:14:27 Firas	<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://firasd.org/inflexion/">http://firasd.org/inflexion/</a><br />
May 11 17:15:06 masquerade	or me<br />
May 11 17:15:06 photomatt	Firas: sounds like a good idea<br />
May 11 17:15:15 Firas	or masquerade<br />
May 11 17:15:25 Firas	ok, carthik<br />
May 11 17:15:27 Firas	it's your floor<br />
May 11 17:16:18 photomatt	professional support?<br />
May 11 17:16:20 carthik	maybe Matt wants to push that to the next meetup?<br />
May 11 17:16:29 carthik	too late... sorry&#160;:)<br />
May 11 17:16:39 photomatt	we've got a few minutes<br />
May 11 17:16:54 photomatt	carthik: what did you think was a good pickup point?<br />
May 11 17:17:08 *	ryanduff|laptop has quit ()<br />
May 11 17:17:25 carthik	The last time we stopped with the pros and cons of "acknowledging" or vouching for professionals who support WP<br />
May 11 17:17:34 carthik	and using the wp-pro list to fill this need<br />
May 11 17:17:56 photomatt	alright<br />
May 11 17:18:06 photomatt	I think OS projects have a natural reputation system<br />
May 11 17:18:13 carthik	I'd say we think about using the wp foundation to drive an effort where everyone can pitch in for the benefit of the foundation, and themselves.<br />
May 11 17:18:18 *	Blackb|rd (klausman@eric.schwarzvogel.de) has left #wordpress-meetup<br />
May 11 17:18:49 carthik	I'd think a WP directed professional support system is better than "just letting it happen"<br />
May 11 17:19:13 carthik	and organized, planned setup is more likely to succeed.<br />
May 11 17:19:19 Semiologic	you could set up a bounty system&#160;:)<br />
May 11 17:19:24 photomatt	well at some point I could envision there being full time WP employees<br />
May 11 17:19:35 chuyskywalker	Semiologic: like google answers...<br />
May 11 17:19:50 Semiologic	<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.semiologic.com/open-source-business-model/">http://www.semiologic.com/open-source-business-model/</a><br />
May 11 17:19:52 Semiologic	like the above link, actually<br />
May 11 17:20:08 Pplproof	May I interject something here...?<br />
May 11 17:20:09 photomatt	Semiologic: yes, read that<br />
May 11 17:20:10 Semiologic	i'm sure plenty of indians will flock to do support<br />
May 11 17:20:14 photomatt	Pplproof: sure<br />
May 11 17:20:21 carthik	photomatt, till we get there, we could have a forum/place where people can submit requests for jobs, which can be assigned to bounty hunters, who will be rated for the way they completed assigned work.<br />
May 11 17:20:29 Firas	Semiologic: wtf<br />
May 11 17:20:29 carthik	moderated by a few<br />
May 11 17:21:07 Pplproof	A number of members of the WP community have been discussing that very idea lately, actually...<br />
May 11 17:21:40 Semiologic	Firas: want paid support in the forums, or not? if you want some, a bounty system could work. e.g. paypal $1 for whever fixes this. a US citizen won't care. an indian might care.<br />
May 11 17:22:05 Firas	semiologic: ok, ok, that statement just rubbed me wrong, sorry<br />
May 11 17:22:07 carthik	Semiologic, why specifically Indians, though, I wonder&#160;:)<br />
May 11 17:22:11 *	Firas is indian<br />
May 11 17:22:30 Pplproof	We've been working on developing an open source business model that's a separate entity entirely, yet still linked to WordPress, offering professional-quality themes as well as paid support.<br />
May 11 17:22:31 MCincubus	India is a great place to outsource tech work... that's all.<br />
May 11 17:22:31 carthik	nevermind, so what are your thoughts, Matt?<br />
May 11 17:22:44 *	westi looks at the clock and realises them time<br />
May 11 17:22:48 westi	night all<br />
May 11 17:22:54 *	westi is now known as westi|gone<br />
May 11 17:22:54 carthik	nite, westi<br />
May 11 17:22:59 Semiologic	carthik: my experience is that ukrainians and russians program better (i work a lot with both). but idians are cool too, and speak better english&#160;:)<br />
May 11 17:23:17 photomatt	there has been some question about whether plugins and/or themes can be non-GPL if distributed<br />
May 11 17:23:33 Firas	photomatt: hmm<br />
May 11 17:23:37 MCincubus	Is there a definitive answer?<br />
May 11 17:23:39 Pplproof	photomatt: Of particular importance to you, 10% of all money we bring in will be donated directly to WordPress development.<br />
May 11 17:24:27 carthik	photomatt, I figure there is nothing stopping them from being non-GPL legally.<br />
May 11 17:24:38 photomatt	MCincubus: I think a good argument could be made for them being virally GPL<br />
May 11 17:24:46 photomatt	since they link lots of internal WP GPL code<br />
May 11 17:24:50 Pplproof	photomatt: We've got a solution to that too.<br />
May 11 17:24:54 Pplproof	:D<br />
May 11 17:24:58 MCincubus	or sometimes take it, modify it, and stick it in.<br />
May 11 17:25:01 photomatt	Pplproof: who's "we"?<br />
May 11 17:25:07 *	Firas is in this thing with pplproof and masquerade and a few others, so is very interested<br />
May 11 17:25:22 Firas	pplproof: he means a legal issue at release time<br />
May 11 17:25:39 carthik	( Semiologic, that's interesting to learn&#160;:) )<br />
May 11 17:26:03 *	Jason__ (~TheJason@12-217-255-187.client.mchsi.com) has joined #wordpress-meetup<br />
May 11 17:26:07 photomatt	I personally don't mind people developing paid themes/plugins<br />
May 11 17:26:14 photomatt	I think it could be a healthy ecosystem<br />
May 11 17:26:15 Pplproof	photomatt: Firas, Jenn, Robert (Masquerade), etc...<br />
May 11 17:26:45 ringmaster|home	But the result should be GPL-licensed, even if the initial work is paid.<br />
May 11 17:26:54 Pplproof	Instead of having separate resources however, bringing them under one umbrella.<br />
May 11 17:26:59 Pplproof	No doubt.<br />
May 11 17:27:01 Semiologic	matt: based on the market study I conducted from my site, I think there's plenty room for hosted wordpress as well<br />
May 11 17:27:04 photomatt	ringmaster: that's been everything I've done<br />
May 11 17:27:14 photomatt	Semiologic: hosted WP is definitely a direction we're headed in<br />
May 11 17:27:26 Firas	photomatt, is there anyone you can talk to about whether they can be (c) or not? to kinda help a demarcated line for people thinking of business models around WP<br />
May 11 17:27:31 carthik	ringmaster, but there is ne legal requirement that states that, I should think.<br />
May 11 17:27:47 Semiologic	send me a notice if you do -- I'm seriously considering a wp business<br />
May 11 17:27:53 MCincubus	you can modify it for private use and not have to share anything.<br />
May 11 17:28:01 photomatt	Firas: I'm not a lawyer, and I don't really know any<br />
May 11 17:28:06 Firas	ok<br />
May 11 17:28:10 photomatt	it probably wouldn't hurt sending a note to the FSF<br />
May 11 17:28:19 relle	photomatt: Get to know some lawyers VERY FAST.<br />
May 11 17:28:34 Firas	i'll find out<br />
May 11 17:29:14 photomatt	alright, might be worth reporting back next week<br />
May 11 17:29:19 carthik	There was a discussion on Alex King's site once about a Mambo Module, GPL and such, might be of interest, Firas.<br />
May 11 17:29:27 relle	There are volunteer legal organizations dedicated to helping "artists" and WordPress might slip in to that realm. They are experts in copyright, trademark, protection, and so on.  Right up WP's alley.<br />
May 11 17:29:38 relle	I'll email you a list next week.<br />
May 11 17:29:44 Pplproof	relle: I've been looking into that actually.&#160;:)<br />
May 11 17:29:51 relle	Then you send him the list.<br />
May 11 17:29:55 carthik	photomatt, but what about prof. support, any thoughts, to conclude?<br />
May 11 17:31:05 photomatt	carthik: I think it's something to continue to pursue, maybe a good first step would to get a list of people who would like to do professional support<br />
May 11 17:31:18 MCincubus	Codex?<br />
May 11 17:31:22 photomatt	and start a discussion among that group as to rates, donations, etc<br />
May 11 17:31:40 carthik	photomatt, maybe a mail (from you) on hackers?<br />
May 11 17:31:59 carthik	a page at the codex, if necessary to keep track.<br />
May 11 17:32:40 Semiologic	projects don't survive on donations. you need a more regular stream of cash than that.<br />
May 11 17:32:57 Firas	make wp-pro more obvious<br />
May 11 17:33:11 Firas	basically, i've seen many people come into irc and ask, where can i get professionals for wp?<br />
May 11 17:33:20 carthik	Firas, that was one of the options consider (inconclusively) the last time.<br />
May 11 17:33:22 relle	On the forum constantly.<br />
May 11 17:33:22 Firas	anything to help the two groups conect would be great<br />
May 11 17:33:23 MCincubus	Yeah... I'm sure that in exchange for a nice open-market for WP work, hosted on a wp.org site, devs would be willing to promise a cut go back to WP<br />
May 11 17:33:25 Semiologic	there's a wp-pro list?<br />
May 11 17:33:38 Pplproof	Exactly my point.<br />
May 11 17:33:38 Pplproof	:/<br />
May 11 17:33:51 carthik	Yeah, for now, perhaps, you could point the souls at wp-pro?<br />
May 11 17:34:12 carthik	but that may "stick" too hard&#160;:)<br />
May 11 17:34:40 Firas	So, what's the resoultion<br />
May 11 17:34:43 photomatt	carthik: I'll send a message out to hackers<br />
May 11 17:34:45 chuyskywalker	And I can imagine resistance to joining an emai llist to get the help<br />
May 11 17:34:48 MCincubus	<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="../../../Mailing_Lists.html">http://codex.wordpress.org/Mailing_Lists</a><br />
May 11 17:34:51 Firas	how are we going to connect freelancers + people looking for work<br />
May 11 17:34:53 *	Provos|T is now known as twistedraisin<br />
May 11 17:35:05 Firas	photomatt: maybe to wp.org/dev blog?<br />
May 11 17:35:16 carthik	photomatt, Firas, so that will be the temporary resolution - and exploration of what it might entail by mailing wp-hackers.<br />
May 11 17:35:30 MCincubus	Best solution: forum specialized for this use.<br />
May 11 17:35:35 carthik	s/and/an<br />
May 11 17:36:13 photomatt	professional support is much more significant in the enterprise space<br />
May 11 17:36:37 Firas	good point<br />
May 11 17:36:39 carthik	right, and for that you need some staff and employees.<br />
May 11 17:36:52 michel_v	it's also more time and resources consuming<br />
May 11 17:36:53 Firas	MCIncubus' idea is good<br />
May 11 17:37:02 Firas	make a forum or a section on the wp forums<br />
May 11 17:37:10 relle	I'm for that.<br />
May 11 17:37:20 photomatt	the last thing we need is more clutter on the forums<br />
May 11 17:37:26 relle	Or a reference list on the Codex, then.<br />
May 11 17:37:31 MCincubus	New forum, I'd say.<br />
May 11 17:37:39 carthik	While on forums, I was, and am a part of <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://blogbarter.com/">http://blogbarter.com</a> - which is just such a forum - not too popular though with WP users as with MT users...<br />
