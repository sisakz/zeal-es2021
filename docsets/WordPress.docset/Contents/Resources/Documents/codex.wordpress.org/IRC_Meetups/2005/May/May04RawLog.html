</p><p>May 04 15:55:17 photomatt	I've got a mini-agenda<br />
May 04 15:55:20 photomatt	to kick things off<br />
May 04 15:55:21 chrisjdavis	whoo hoo!<br />
May 04 15:55:29 jonabad	agendas! this is serious<br />
May 04 15:55:45 photomatt	whether the channel can stay on-topic for an hour remains to be seen<br />
May 04 15:55:52 chrisjdavis	heh<br />
May 04 15:55:55 rboren	Let the Dark Cabal come to order.<br />
May 04 15:55:58 chrisjdavis	yeah I have to see that one<br />
May 04 15:56:09 *	_nickname (~ignis@ti400720a080-14498.bb.online.no) has joined #wordpress<br />
May 04 15:56:14 photomatt	rboren: don't we still have seven minutes left?<br />
May 04 15:56:14 FrankieShakes	guys, if I've given write access to .htaccess, where in WP does it automatically modify the file?  In v1.2 the .htaccess file would appear directly under the area where you set the permalink structure.  Where in 1.5 does it show up?<br />
May 04 15:56:33 photomatt	FrankieShakes: it automatically writes it if it can<br />
May 04 15:56:42 photomatt	FrankieShakes: so you don't need to copy/paste anything<br />
May 04 15:56:43 chrisjdavis	FrankieShakes: it should be in $siteroot<br />
May 04 15:56:50 chrisjdavis	where ever that is<br />
May 04 15:57:02 FrankieShakes	photomatt: hmm... okay, cause I've given .htaccess write access, but it doesn't seem to be updating<br />
May 04 15:57:06 masquerade	when you visit the options-&gt;permalinks page and hit update it will definitely try to write them, and I believe it tells you if it doesn't<br />
May 04 15:57:41 chrisjdavis	hmmm<br />
May 04 15:57:41 *	skippy looks around shiftily.<br />
May 04 15:57:45 chrisjdavis	going home<br />
May 04 15:57:49 ColdForged	cya!@<br />
May 04 15:57:51 chrisjdavis	I might be back on<br />
May 04 15:57:54 skippy	be well chrisjdavis <br />
May 04 15:57:57 chrisjdavis	no promises<br />
May 04 15:58:01 chrisjdavis	skippy: I will try<br />
May 04 15:58:02 *	chrisjdavis has quit (Remote closed the connection)<br />
May 04 15:58:44 skippy	I could use a cool adult beverage.<br />
May 04 15:58:49 *	skippy looks around.<br />
May 04 15:58:51 skeltoac	oh, ditto.<br />
May 04 15:58:51 skippy	Damn.<br />
May 04 15:59:01 skippy	not a Guinness in sight.<br />
May 04 15:59:10 FrankieShakes	okay... I think it's writing now!<br />
May 04 15:59:35 photomatt	FrankieShakes: excellent<br />
May 04 15:59:35 skippy	photomatt: throw the agenda onto codex so we can all peek, and annotate as necessary<br />
May 04 15:59:47 photomatt	good idea<br />
May 04 15:59:48 skippy	collaboration++<br />
May 04 15:59:55 ColdForged	ohhh<br />
May 04 16:00:01 FrankieShakes	photomatt: I shouldn't need to restart apache after the change, right?<br />
May 04 16:00:08 ColdForged	no Frankie<br />
May 04 16:00:24 FrankieShakes	hmm... not working<br />
May 04 16:00:44 skippy	anything in your error log, FrankieShakes&#160;?<br />
May 04 16:00:45 *	Firenze has quit (Nick collision from services.)<br />
May 04 16:00:51 *	_nickname is now known as Firenze<br />
May 04 16:00:51 FrankieShakes	I'm running PHP5... and when I load the php_info page, under "loaded modules" it shows mod_rewrite<br />
May 04 16:01:02 FrankieShakes	skippy: checking...<br />
May 04 16:02:13 skippy	photomatt: the column header "freshness" in the support forums is misleading.  The bottom post isn't "2 hours fresh"...<br />
May 04 16:02:40 masquerade	skippy, it was fresh two hours ago<br />
May 04 16:03:07 skippy	yes, but we don't say it's got a freshness of two hours.<br />
May 04 16:03:08 *	jefte (~jp@rrcs-24-227-116-130.se.biz.rr.com) has joined #wordpress<br />
May 04 16:03:09 _infobot	Willkommen, bienvenue, welcome jefte, im Cabaret, au Cabaret, to Cabaret<br />
May 04 16:03:20 FrankieShakes	skippy: restarted apache... nothing obvious in the error log... this is the only thing that displayed:<br />
May 04 16:03:28 Firenze	anyone here running wp on powweb?<br />
May 04 16:03:30 FrankieShakes	Processing config directory: /private/etc/httpd/users/*.conf<br />
May 04 16:03:31 FrankieShakes	 Processing config file: /private/etc/httpd/users/frank.conf<br />
May 04 16:03:31 FrankieShakes	[Wed May  4 17:00:28 2005] [warn] module mod_php5.c is already added, skipping<br />

May 04 16:03:35 *	photomatt has changed the topic to: WordPress IRC Meetup - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="../../../IRC_Meetups.html">http://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups</a> || Channel being logged || Save support for forums<br />
May 04 16:03:37 FrankieShakes	[Wed May  4 17:00:28 2005] [notice] Accept mutex: flock (Default: flock)<br />
May 04 16:03:45 HauntedUnix	photomatt: Where's it logged to<br />
May 04 16:03:47 Firenze	friend of mine wants to host a blog there but doesn't know whether all features will work<br />
May 04 16:03:58 *	masquerade is logging, and i believe jonabad is also<br />
May 04 16:03:59 photomatt	FrankieShakes: We're getting started, could you take it to private messages or the forums?<br />
May 04 16:04:08 *	tanuki (~bgeiger@dialup-4.247.170.7.Dial1.Tampa1.Level3.net) has joined #wordpress<br />
May 04 16:04:09 _infobot	tanuki is a larger-than-life (but gradually deflating) geek, college student, navel gazer, and blogger: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://bgeiger.net/weblog/">http://bgeiger.net/weblog/</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://begeiger.blog.usf.edu/">http://begeiger.blog.usf.edu/</a><br />
May 04 16:04:10 HauntedUnix	Mm'kay, sory&#160;:-)<br />
May 04 16:04:16 FrankieShakes	photomatt: sure thing... thanks for your help thus far... much appreciated!<br />
May 04 16:04:22 FrankieShakes	skippy: do you mind assisting in pm?<br />
May 04 16:04:23 photomatt	Okay the agenda is on the wiki page in the topic<br />
May 04 16:04:23 masquerade	photomatt, why not move the IRC meetup to another chan so support can continue here..<br />
May 04 16:04:25 *	tanuki_ has quit (Connection timed out)<br />
May 04 16:04:32 skippy	shouldn't WE take it somewhere private, since we post all over that #wordpress is for support&#160;?<br />
May 04 16:04:49 Firenze	$def Firenze is an anonymous blogger. mwhahaha<br />
May 04 16:04:49 _infobot	Firenze is an anonymous blogger. mwhahaha<br />
May 04 16:04:58 skippy	FrankieShakes: I can try to help, but can't promise much.<br />
May 04 16:05:04 photomatt	Okay, maybe the role of #wordpress is a better first topic&#160;:)<br />
May 04 16:05:17 photomatt	That was more #4, scaling support<br />
May 04 16:06:04 photomatt	as a method for support, IRC is very hit/miss. great if someone is there who has time to help you, horrible if people are chatting and ignoring you<br />
May 04 16:06:29 photomatt	during an active conversation things can scroll off after less than a minute<br />
May 04 16:06:51 photomatt	Podz has complained numerous times of not getting any help here himself, that's why he didn't like IRC for a while<br />
May 04 16:06:52 *	ryanpc (~ryanc@168-103-148-210.tukw.qwest.net) has joined #wordpress<br />
May 04 16:06:53 _infobot	Willkommen, bienvenue, welcome ryanpc, im Cabaret, au Cabaret, to Cabaret<br />
May 04 16:07:14 photomatt	(and then everyone stopped talking)<br />
May 04 16:07:28 skippy	with respect to support:<br />
May 04 16:07:39 skippy	in the last month or so, I think #wordpress has really shaped up.<br />
May 04 16:07:43 Podz	it's an inherent fault of #irc<br />
May 04 16:07:51 photomatt	oh, hi Podz&#160;:)<br />
May 04 16:07:54 Podz	and I totally agree with what skippy just said&#160;:)<br />
May 04 16:07:56 skippy	I think enough people now have enough proficiency with 1.5 to offer helpful, useful comments.<br />
May 04 16:07:58 Podz	Hi Matt&#160;:)<br />
May 04 16:08:02 *	ColdForged nods<br />
May 04 16:08:18 skippy	when 1.5 first came out, we were all struggling to make sense of it for ourselves.<br />
May 04 16:08:31 photomatt	that makes sense<br />
May 04 16:08:34 HauntedUnix	Personally I believe IRC is a wonderful medium for support, however if you *ban* offtopic chatter here, the channel will die. I'd like to see the implementation of an in-house paid support, to say; fuel development, and greater emphasis on the use of the forums for support, however IRC should still be left as a strong-hold, as it is a realtime conversational mean.<br />
May 04 16:08:40 *	westi|wah is now known as westi<br />
May 04 16:08:50 westi	evening all<br />
May 04 16:08:52 jefte	not to mention the slew of 3rd party plugins and features we now have available...<br />
May 04 16:08:52 skippy	now we're in a pretty good "comfort zone" -- many known bugs are well identified; and lots of people are comfortabel int he code.<br />
May 04 16:09:10 twistedraisin	chuckg: there is the wordpress-pro mailing list<br />
May 04 16:09:18 twistedraisin	err HU, rather<br />
May 04 16:09:18 chuckg	Hmm?<br />
May 04 16:09:19 photomatt	does anyone here need support right now? since we already announced #wordpress as the channel for this week we can stay here and go to another channel next week<br />
May 04 16:09:26 *	presroi (~tir@p54B0E46F.dip.t-dialin.net) has joined #wordpress<br />
May 04 16:09:28 presroi	hi<br />
May 04 16:09:53 HauntedUnix	twistedraisin: Less as a mailing list, more as an organised, centralised system.<br />
May 04 16:10:18 photomatt	paid support of some sort has been a semi-common request<br />
May 04 16:10:19 Podz	If anyone does, tell them to PM me so it beeps here and I'll see what I can do. I'm fiddling with my sites right now<br />
May 04 16:10:22 skippy	I would like to think that actual moderators for #wordpress would help; but I don't know if they really would.<br />
May 04 16:10:30 photomatt	my hesinance is that free support with wither if we offer paid support<br />
May 04 16:10:34 photomatt	*hesitance<br />
May 04 16:10:36 *	ringmaster (~ringmaste@146.145.52.102) has joined #wordpress<br />
May 04 16:10:37 _infobot	ringmaster is Owen Winkler of asymptomatic.net/redalt.com, author of EzStatic, Exhibit, and BAStats plugins for WordPress.<br />
May 04 16:10:57 HauntedUnix	photomatt: The Gallery Project, although not quite parallel to Wordpress, offer both paid and free, and seem to get on with it just dandy.<br />
May 04 16:11:12 photomatt	HauntedUnix: I'll check out how they're doing that<br />
May 04 16:11:14 twistedraisin	photomatt: maybe some sort of wp-consulants site like guru or something? Thatway those that want to support wordpress, can.<br />
May 04 16:11:15 *	Clintology has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))<br />
May 04 16:11:45 HauntedUnix	photomatt: Would you like me to ask one of the Gallery contributors to pop in?<br />
May 04 16:11:51 skippy	I think paid support should be an independent operation; and not something run/sponsored by WordPress directly.<br />
May 04 16:12:04 photomatt	<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://gallery.menalto.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=GalleryPaidSupport&amp;file=index">http://gallery.menalto.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=GalleryPaidSupport&amp;file=index</a><br />
May 04 16:12:07 photomatt	that's the gallery page<br />
May 04 16:12:07 masquerade	skippy, that would be known as "professional consulting"<br />
May 04 16:12:09 HauntedUnix	skippy: I've been presented with that idea, however I still think if it were in house, it'd receive a greater support.<br />
May 04 16:12:10 *	Clintology (~Clint@nr30-216-196-141-153.fuse.net) has joined #wordpress<br />
May 04 16:12:16 photomatt	skippy: that's how it happens now, but it's hard for people to find it<br />
May 04 16:12:23 westi	i agree with skippy ... paid support could be something recommended much like the hosting page on wp.org<br />
May 04 16:12:27 photomatt	I would imagine it being somewhat of a marketplace hosted by WP<br />
May 04 16:12:30 HauntedUnix	skippy: Also there's then the guarantee for the money to be better plowed back into WP.<br />
May 04 16:12:37 photomatt	yes, like the hosting page somewhat<br />
May 04 16:13:04 skippy	yes, but it creates a dichotomy to our users.  "Oh, I didn't PAY so my bug report will get less attention"...<br />
May 04 16:13:08 westi	maybe a prerequist of being listed on wp.org would be that you pledge to donate something back to wordpress from the moey you make<br />
May 04 16:13:13 skippy	even if it's not true, that will be a perception.<br />
May 04 16:13:31 photomatt	skippy: but support&#160;!= bug reports and fixing<br />
May 04 16:13:38 HauntedUnix	skippy: bug reports =! ..ah, nevermind<br />
May 04 16:13:44 westi	you should never have to pay to get bugs fixed .. support is about heling people install surely<br />
May 04 16:13:50 HauntedUnix	skippy: I meant less bug reporting, things like that, more.. advanced users who will fix specific problems, set up others blogs, et cetera.<br />
May 04 16:14:33 skippy	fair enough.  Out of curiosity, how many support forum requests would be channeled to paid support, at a guess?<br />
May 04 16:15:01 MCincubus	probably the ones that are currently answered as "yeah, you could do that, but you'd have to write a plugin for it"<br />
May 04 16:15:03 phenny	MCincubus: 15:34Z &lt;Admiral_Justin&gt; tell MCincubus that I posted a workaround to the javascript issues with app/x+x to his post about the mime types<br />
May 04 16:15:30 photomatt	I would see people as starting with the paid support rather than going to the forums first<br />
May 04 16:15:50 photomatt	maybe Podz can speak to how he thinks the forums could react<br />
May 04 16:15:54 jefte	On the topic of support, I for one would not pay for support<br />
May 04 16:16:24 *	versuchsanstalt (~burki@p5481D710.dip.t-dialin.net) has joined #wordpress<br />
May 04 16:16:24 _infobot	versuchsanstalt is <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.versuchsanstalt.org/wordpress/">http://www.versuchsanstalt.org/wordpress/</a> (blogging about this &amp; that &amp; culture &amp; the media. in german though. dreaming of a place in the web that's all about culture &amp; collaboration.) &amp; GNU/Linux audio<br />
May 04 16:16:28 jefte	and while I do use the forums - wish for a better system for oganizing the posts<br />
May 04 16:16:45 shep	i don't like the new tags at the top of the forums<br />
May 04 16:16:45 HauntedUnix	jefte: Say you were a new, inexperienced user, and you had real problems with getting things working, do you think you still wouldn't pay?<br />
May 04 16:16:48 shep	bt that's just me<br />
May 04 16:16:48 *	ryanpc has quit (Remote closed the connection)<br />
May 04 16:17:02 shep	i don't see why people would have to pay<br />
May 04 16:17:05 skippy	the other problem with paid support is that the folks who contribute for free have a real disincentive for continuing.  (I'm specifically thinking of my own contributions to the codex)<br />
May 04 16:17:11 masquerade	many users would not pay for support, but the ones that would be willing to pay would get a guarantee of a support staff's time to help diagnose and fix the problem<br />
May 04 16:17:12 jefte	I think because of the nature of the product (free, open-source) I don't expect to pay, to get the product to run<br />
May 04 16:17:17 shep	the support forums and this channel give help in a very timely matter<br />
May 04 16:17:29 Podz	to support&#160;? You have the very easy stuff and grateful people through to the "I want it MY way and I'll pay pennies". I have had a few of them nag me to death so I avoid them at all costs now. the tricky part is saying enough is enough and drawing the line at the start.<br />
May 04 16:17:30 westi	from what i have seen on the forums a lot of people are willing to pay - mainly for theming but also for support in general<br />
May 04 16:17:54 photomatt	jefte: I don't think the target audience would be anyone in this chat or on the hackers list<br />
May 04 16:18:11 shep	the people in the forums that are willing to pay are people who seem to have lost hope<br />
May 04 16:18:11 photomatt	jefte: it's people who need more hand-holding than the forums can provide<br />
May 04 16:18:16 jefte	and I don't think I'm alone in this feeling. Most people looking for cheap solutions typically don't want to be encumbered with trying to set it up. Lucky for me - Word Press was easy to install. I'm the weakest hacker on the list.<br />
May 04 16:18:18 HauntedUnix	Do you think it'd be unreasonable to ask for $20 for a customisation of WP?<br />
May 04 16:18:21 jonabad	westi: like a wordpress extended warranty<br />
May 04 16:18:30 shep	sure those people can still pay someone for help, but we shouldn't make support a paying issue<br />
May 04 16:18:38 shep	i know i love to help people out<br />
May 04 16:18:44 shep	as rare is it may be<br />
May 04 16:18:49 photomatt	free support would NEVER be eliminated, the codex would never go away, etc<br />
May 04 16:18:53 jefte	photomatt: while I'm on the list, I use it as a way to keep a thumb on the wp pulse. I cannot code well - more often than not I am breaking code.<br />
May 04 16:18:54 shep	remember, i'm just comic relief in here<br />
May 04 16:19:00 westi	HauntedUnix: sounds reasonable for a custom theme to solve someones needs.. if not cheap really considering how many hours can go into theming<br />
May 04 16:19:02 masquerade	I think that if anything, we should avoid calling it "Paid Support" and do something along the lines of "Professional Consulting"<br />
May 04 16:19:03 HauntedUnix	I think a social contract could do with adding in, Matt.<br />
May 04 16:19:11 Podz	I think the main point about paying is to get people to search better. I still do tons of free install etc - as I'm sure others here do - but I /had/ to put the pay thing on my pages because it was getting very silly the amount of mail and IM's I was getting<br />
May 04 16:19:15 shep	that may work<br />
May 04 16:19:22 shep	professional consulting<br />
May 04 16:19:22 skippy	photomatt: it's not a matter of it going away.  It's a matter of someone else making money from my effort to document something on the codex.  That irks em.<br />
May 04 16:19:24 MCincubus	masquerade, agreed.<br />
May 04 16:19:27 skippy	s/em/me<br />
May 04 16:19:35 skeltoac	It could be as simple as adding a category on the forums: Help For Hire.<br />
May 04 16:19:46 shep	skippy: makes since<br />
May 04 16:19:48 shep	sense<br />
May 04 16:19:48 jefte	thats not a bad idea actually...<br />
May 04 16:19:51 shep	man i can't type<br />
May 04 16:20:07 photomatt	skippy: how would someone be profiting off your codex work any more than they're profiting off the work of devs on WP?<br />
May 04 16:20:30 MCincubus	and if the info is freely available, the user could just use it themselves<br />
May 04 16:20:38 skippy	photomatt: hey, if you guys don't care, I can't stop you.  I'm voicing my opinion.  One of 96, presently.<br />
May 04 16:20:42 masquerade	I think that if someone wants to be a paid consultant, then power to them, but it shouldn't be something endorsed by WordPress as much as regular support<br />
May 04 16:20:59 westi	photomatt: i think that would be if people are charging for providing info to users that is freely available cause the use can't be bothered to search properly<br />
May 04 16:21:09 HauntedUnix	I think iof we did offer support, we'd have to have some sort of *organisation* to it.<br />
May 04 16:21:18 HauntedUnix	If we just let anyone go at it, they could end up posing as a WP dev, and ripping people off.<br />
May 04 16:21:22 skeltoac	Too many users prefer to have it done for them and are willing to pay. Open the door for those people and you could multiply the WordPress user base.<br />
May 04 16:21:30 photomatt	HauntedUnix: that's a big concern too<br />
May 04 16:21:30 Podz	And if a "Paid Supporter" seeks help for a client&#160;? You WILL have idiots doing that<br />
May 04 16:21:31 shep	the info is freely out there, but some people just get frustrated, or want other people to do all the work themselves<br />
May 04 16:21:34 masquerade	WordPress' support has grown to the point that the ones who are looking for quick fixes and such can find them easily on the codex. The people who need their hand held through every bit might be interested in consulting rather than "support"<br />
May 04 16:21:44 shep	and i guess if that's the case, a consiltant isn't a bad idea<br />
May 04 16:21:48 shep	consultant<br />
May 04 16:22:01 photomatt	all the information is out there to do anything, all the way down to the source code, I think for most people it's a matter of having the time to grok it<br />
May 04 16:22:07 skeltoac	Independent consulting is already a fact.<br />
May 04 16:22:07 SteamedPenguin	save support for forums?<br />
May 04 16:22:10 HauntedUnix	I'd like to see a system similar to Gallery, whilst  keeping the individuality.<br />
May 04 16:22:13 SteamedPenguin	WTF is that?<br />
May 04 16:22:14 HauntedUnix	SteamedPenguin: During the meeting, I presume.<br />
May 04 16:22:22 photomatt	We have a mailing list of professional WP consultants, it hasn't had much traffic<br />
May 04 16:22:32 SteamedPenguin	ah<br />
May 04 16:22:35 skeltoac	I've never seen it advertised!<br />
May 04 16:22:37 SteamedPenguin	oops<br />
May 04 16:22:38 jefte	nore I<br />
May 04 16:22:41 shep	neither have i<br />
May 04 16:22:45 shep	i never knew about it<br />
May 04 16:22:50 MCincubus	Heh, I remember it being mentioned, in passing<br />
May 04 16:22:50 jonabad	I had to dig around to get into it<br />
May 04 16:22:53 photomatt	okay, well that's a first problem<br />
May 04 16:22:56 skeltoac	Right.<br />
May 04 16:22:57 jefte	hahahah clearly.<br />
May 04 16:23:03 photomatt	where should it go on the site?<br />
May 04 16:23:08 shep	and i'm betting that 98% of the people on the board (100% of newbs) don't know<br />
May 04 16:23:15 skeltoac	Probably as a sticky in the forums.<br />
May 04 16:23:16 ringmaster	WordPress SUPPORT: $50/ hour.  Email me.  (Now you have.)<br />
May 04 16:23:19 westi	photomatt: on the subject of grok'ing .. maybe the support page on wp.org should link to the codex... then people might search there first aswell as the forums before asking the same questions over and over<br />
May 04 16:23:33 skeltoac	YES<br />
May 04 16:23:36 Firenze	can someone please tell me, why a domain like blah.com is a 2 level domain? what's a first level then?<br />
May 04 16:23:43 shep	i also think there should be a clear link to this room<br />
May 04 16:23:45 skippy	Firenze: com is the first<br />
May 04 16:24:01 shep	there are a lot of people in here that give great help<br />
May 04 16:24:07 skippy	Is there some requirement for joining the WP Pro list?   Can anybody join?<br />
May 04 16:24:07 photomatt	shep: I'm hesitant to drive newbies to IRC or any other ephemeral medium<br />
May 04 16:24:11 skeltoac	Firenze: com is called a Top Level Domain.<br />
May 04 16:24:11 Firenze	blah.com is second, woot.blah.com is 3rd<br />
May 04 16:24:13 shep	plus geeksmakemehot likes to play truth or dare<br />
May 04 16:24:18 Firenze	that's what's confusing me<br />
May 04 16:24:20 photomatt	IRC is unsearchable, not publicly archived, etc<br />
May 04 16:24:24 shep	true<br />
May 04 16:24:25 jefte	photomatt: Maybe you could list all mailing lists in the right column of the support page?<br />
May 04 16:24:33 photomatt	a question answered in the forums may help 10 people instead of 1<br />
May 04 16:24:41 ColdForged	[17:22] photomatt: a question answered in the forums may help 10 people instead of 1 ++<br />
May 04 16:24:49 masquerade	jefte, while that might sound like a good idea, our Hackers list would be flooded with support questions in no time at all<br />
May 04 16:24:52 photomatt	jefte: except the mailing lists are expressly NOT for support<br />
May 04 16:24:53 Firenze	skeltoac&#160;:: yes, thanks you, but it was not what i was asking<br />
May 04 16:24:56 photomatt	except wp-testers, which is for nightlies<br />
May 04 16:24:59 jonabad	I think there ought to be a way to search both codex and forums<br />
May 04 16:25:00 shep	photomatt: but it should be clearly stated somewhere, that there is a IRC room if all other support fails<br />
May 04 16:25:01 skeltoac	Yes, I still get hits referred from my Blogger Importer posts on the forums.<br />
May 04 16:25:09 jefte	good points<br />
May 04 16:25:24 photomatt	also some insane number of searches are run on the forums per day<br />
May 04 16:25:35 jefte	so how do we make available a list of wp consultants for people to tap into and pay for hand-holding help?<br />
May 04 16:25:37 *	nosebleed|work has quit ("For every action, there's an equal but opposite excuse")<br />
May 04 16:25:37 photomatt	I think it was 5 figures or close to it<br />
May 04 16:25:49 westi	photomatt: do they produce good results though?<br />
May 04 16:26:11 photomatt	westi: no/yes<br />
May 04 16:26:11 skeltoac	I think a list of consultants is trouble. It implies endorsement and trust.<br />
May 04 16:26:11 westi	the same questions do seem to come up that can be answered by a simple targeted search<br />
May 04 16:26:25 jonabad	photomatt: i definitely search like 5 times for 1 answer<br />
May 04 16:26:35 photomatt	how about a subpage of /about/ is added that links to the WP PRo list<br />
May 04 16:26:39 jefte	well the wp-consultants list is effectively this - but unendorsed?<br />
May 04 16:26:43 photomatt	I can call it "Professional Consultants"<br />
May 04 16:26:57 SteamedPenguin	besides, should it be wp.org's mission to 'advertise' consultants? who gets on the list, who gets off?<br />
May 04 16:27:09 photomatt	and mention that the wp-pro list is essentially a marketplace to reach people interested in WP work<br />
May 04 16:27:13 trevorturk	photomatt, (knowing that you made bbpress) why not use punbb? i love it.<br />
May 04 16:27:20 *	westi would like a feed of activity on forum posts he has authored/ replied to .. is that possible?<br />
May 04 16:27:43 masquerade	westi, hack away at bbpress and about anything is possible<br />
May 04 16:27:49 MCincubus	well, it either has to be explicit endorsement, or explicit non-endorsement (and an open forum)<br />
May 04 16:27:52 skippy	photomatt: is the Pro list for solicitation of business?<br />
May 04 16:27:55 photomatt	trevorturk: when the forums started punbb used tables everywhere, was really hard to integrate with the design, and still doesn't support tags<br />
May 04 16:27:58 ringmaster	Any list of consultants is not a matter of endorsing anyone.  It's about centralizing the list.  Any display of such a list could clearly deny endorsement.<br />
May 04 16:28:03 westi	masquerade: i will... when i have the time!<br />
May 04 16:28:07 skippy	if so, that sounds like chaos: "Who wants to help me?!"  "me me me!"<br />
May 04 16:28:16 photomatt	skippy: that's how markets work<br />
May 04 16:28:26 skeltoac	Yup.<br />
May 04 16:28:32 photomatt	that's also how the Six Apart pronet works<br />
May 04 16:28:34 photomatt	FYI<br />
May 04 16:28:36 trevorturk	photomatt, that's true - pubb could use some sweet wp-esqe theme feature!<br />
May 04 16:28:49 jefte	I can see it now, wp "consultants" barking out for customers in a digital marketplace.<br />
May 04 16:28:49 SteamedPenguin	ah yes<br />
May 04 16:28:52 HauntedUnix	Can I suggest, there's an ML of people who are *authorised* by either WP Foundation, or a third-party entity which are covering this. Each support ticket is sent to the ML, and each member from the ML is listed on the website?<br />

May 04 16:29:16 SteamedPenguin	emulating six apart, always a good path<br />
May 04 16:29:19 skeltoac	If it's an open market we need, the forums might be a good place to host it. Just adding the Help For Hire category could do the trick.<br />
May 04 16:29:19 photomatt	HauntedUnix: authorising people is a VERY slippery slope<br />
May 04 16:29:32 photomatt	SteamedPenguin: learning from other's mistakes and successes is always good&#160;:)<br />
May 04 16:29:41 ColdForged	Could be broken down by specialties: design, CSS, template tags, plugins<br />
May 04 16:29:44 SteamedPenguin	photomatt: six apart is a company<br />
May 04 16:29:44 photomatt	skeltoac: trying to minimize the non-support traffic on the forums<br />
May 04 16:29:45 HauntedUnix	photomatt: I'd say people you trust, people who have exhibited themselves as able, and those who you know will work when they have to.. it's a bit favourist, but it's the best ay to go<br />
May 04 16:29:51 skeltoac	Of course, it would need the disclaimer at the top&#160;:)<br />
May 04 16:29:58 shep	if you do the consulting thing you def need to make sure that you don't claim any responsibility<br />
May 04 16:30:11 photomatt	HauntedUnix: that'd be very elitist, would exclude newcomers, and just because I like someone doesn't mean they're good to hire<br />
May 04 16:30:25 shep	you don't want people to get pissed because their "consultant" didn't do what they wanted<br />
May 04 16:30:30 ringmaster	Something like elance.com but focused at WP would be handy.<br />
May 04 16:30:37 shep	and yell at WP, when it wasn't WP's fault<br />
May 04 16:30:40 photomatt	ringmaster: sure, with rating and history, etc<br />
May 04 16:30:43 shep	a clear division must be there<br />
May 04 16:30:47 HauntedUnix	photomatt: I mean to avoid favourtism as much as possible, but to go with people who you're sure you can trust. Perhaps do... a test of some sort?<br />
May 04 16:30:49 photomatt	ringmaster: but that's Lots of Work<br />
May 04 16:30:53 ringmaster	too true.<br />
May 04 16:30:54 jefte	sounds like a whole new site to me - wp-consultants.com<br />
May 04 16:30:56 SteamedPenguin	photomatt: operating an open source project like operating a commercial company only beholden to its masters is different<br />
May 04 16:30:57 masquerade	I move that we table this discussion and move on to another topic, leave paid support for the next meeting<br />
May 04 16:31:10 shep	ok<br />
May 04 16:31:15 jefte	seconded.<br />
May 04 16:31:21 shep	all in favor\<br />
May 04 16:31:22 skeltoac	hear hear. sleep on it.<br />
May 04 16:31:23 SteamedPenguin	photomatt: on the other hand, there is no reason why there can't be acompany that's centered around offering WP services and integration<br />
May 04 16:31:24 shep	aye<br />
May 04 16:31:25 ringmaster	aye.<br />
May 04 16:31:26 MCincubus	aye<br />

May 04 16:31:29 HauntedUnix	GOatse.<br />
May 04 16:31:30 trevorturk	is this about an alternative to the wp-pro mailing list?<br />
May 04 16:31:30 photomatt	alright<br />
May 04 16:31:31 masquerade	let everyone refine their thoughts and opinions and we'll get some better discussion<br />
May 04 16:31:42 photomatt	&lt;/consultants&gt;<br />
May 04 16:31:45 SteamedPenguin	heh<br />
May 04 16:31:48 photomatt	&lt;1.5.1&gt;<br />
May 04 16:31:50 ColdForged	ba-dum-tish<br />
May 04 16:32:10 photomatt	Okay 1.5.1 needs to go out ASAP, what are the outstanding bugs?<br />
May 04 16:32:11 ColdForged	It was released yesterday, right?<br />
May 04 16:32:11 twistedraisin	heh, what major outstandings are there still before 1.5.1?<br />
May 04 16:32:23 photomatt	ColdForged: in a perfect world&#160;:)<br />
May 04 16:32:23 ColdForged	&lt;/joke&gt;<br />
May 04 16:32:25 MCincubus	have there been any problems with the RSS and CURL stuff?<br />
May 04 16:32:40 photomatt	MCincubus: I checked in something that used curl if it was available, fopen if it wasn't<br />
May 04 16:32:46 masquerade	MCincubus, I believe that was fixed<br />
May 04 16:32:54 twistedraisin	not since 1.3a versions, iirc<br />
May 04 16:32:55 MCincubus	so no one has been having problems with it?<br />
May 04 16:33:07 *	milk has quit ("www.milkmiruku.com / brb")<br />
May 04 16:33:11 rboren	Assuming curl works out and the 304 fix works out, I think 1.5.1 is ready.<br />

May 04 16:33:52 skeltoac	I'm not running nightlies, but i had trouble with CURL on a GoDaddy-hosted account. Required a proxy.<br />
May 04 16:34:02 shep	what is CURL?<br />
May 04 16:34:10 SteamedPenguin	while not a major bug, WP 1.5 is still missing Atom feeds.<br />

May 04 16:34:33 photomatt	SteamedPenguin: Missing atom feeds??<br />

May 04 16:34:43 skeltoac	(basically0<br />
May 04 16:34:48 SteamedPenguin	photomatt: yeah, comment Atom feeds.<br />
May 04 16:34:49 photomatt	SteamedPenguin: if you mean comment feeds, that's not going to make this release<br />
May 04 16:35:07 SteamedPenguin	photomatt: I gathered as much.<br />
May 04 16:35:13 twistedraisin	photomatt: is it on the roadmap at all?<br />
May 04 16:35:19 photomatt	I believe your bug is still open on that though?<br />
May 04 16:35:19 westi	photomatt: and shouldn't if 1.5.1 is "just bug fixes"&#160;;)<br />
May 04 16:35:53 photomatt	it's bug fixes and enhancements<br />
May 04 16:35:58 masquerade	As far as the RSS 304 bug, its been working fine here<br />
May 04 16:36:11 masquerade	with CVS checked out a few minutes ago<br />
May 04 16:36:21 photomatt	masquerade: does it return 304s when it's supposed to?<br />
May 04 16:36:56 masquerade	photomatt, Yep, and its not sending it when there are updates<br />
May 04 16:37:14 photomatt	can anyone else confirm? I'd like to close that bug<br />

May 04 16:39:12 shep	anything else on the list<br />
May 04 16:39:33 rboren	Did we address everything with Waldegger?<br />
May 04 16:39:34 photomatt	The new hosting page, any feedback?<br />
May 04 16:39:38 MCincubus	Should there be a grace period, before it is released?  i.e. let the wp-hackers and wp-testers people pound it and try to break it for a few days?<br />
May 04 16:39:51 shep	i think its helpful<br />
May 04 16:39:53 ringmaster	Is it supposed to be sending back a last_modified header?<br />

May 04 16:40:06 _infobot	Milords, Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome twood<br />
May 04 16:40:12 shep	some people aren't sure what hosts to use, and that can lead them in the right direction<br />
May 04 16:40:21 skeltoac	I'd like to know how much the new hosting page is increasing WP's cash flow.<br />
May 04 16:40:26 shep	and at least allow them to see what kind of specs they should be looking for<br />
May 04 16:40:27 SteamedPenguin	MCincubus: say seven days?<br />
May 04 16:40:43 MCincubus	SteamedPenguin, that would be plenty, methinks<br />
May 04 16:40:48 photomatt	MCincubus: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-testers/2005-April/000171.html">http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-testers/2005-April/000171.html</a><br />
May 04 16:40:51 westi	photomatt: hosting page is good,,, my only comment is it is unclear to me why powerweb is being highlighted - does it mean that wordpress recommends it above the others for ex?<br />
May 04 16:41:04 shep	westi: i had the same question<br />
May 04 16:41:34 westi	also should the list self randomize so that it appears in a different order each time so as not to show preference?<br />
May 04 16:41:45 MCincubus	Eek, I hope not.<br />
May 04 16:41:52 MCincubus	PowWeb wouldn't be my first choice.<br />
May 04 16:42:04 photomatt	w/r/t PowWeb, right now they have the best combo of a WP auto-install, phone support for WP, specs, and donating back to WP<br />
May 04 16:42:23 photomatt	the order doesn't seem to effect what people click on<br />
May 04 16:42:30 photomatt	Laughing Squid has the second most clicks on that page<br />
May 04 16:42:38 Podz	cute logo&#160;:)<br />
May 04 16:42:42 jonabad	great name<br />
May 04 16:42:44 westi	Podz:&#160;:)<br />
May 04 16:42:51 photomatt	even though they're at the end<br />
May 04 16:42:59 shep	i clicked it cause of name<br />
May 04 16:43:05 photomatt	so that tells me people are reading the whole page, which is what we want anyway<br />
May 04 16:43:24 shep	photomatt: why only those hosts?<br />
May 04 16:43:25 *	nacken_ has quit (Connection timed out)<br />
May 04 16:43:26 photomatt	it's not one-size-fits-all<br />
May 04 16:43:41 photomatt	shep: a combo of big and small, but all high quality IMO<br />
May 04 16:43:50 westi	photomatt: thats cool then... i think you have to be careful not to accidentally show preference.. or imply preference when its not there ... thats all<br />
May 04 16:43:53 photomatt	rboren: it's still possible to load template files directly<br />
May 04 16:44:00 shep	ok, i was just wondering, cause i noticed a lot of people use Site5, and that's not on there<br />
May 04 16:44:07 photomatt	rboren: we can't .htaccess it because that'd also block CSS/images in that directory and wouldn't work on IIS anyway<br />
May 04 16:44:08 MCincubus	could randomize it, if you eventually add a lot of hosts<br />
May 04 16:44:24 photomatt	rboren: I wouldn't want to add crap to the top of every template file either<br />
May 04 16:44:45 rboren	Nor I.<br />
May 04 16:44:46 photomatt	MCincubus: there are plenty of hosting directories where people can see a lot of hosts, we want to highlight just a few<br />
May 04 16:45:02 photomatt	the page will never have more than 5, and will probably have fewer in the future<br />
May 04 16:45:17 MCincubus	Yeah, I think your disclaimer covers that<br />
May 04 16:45:25 chye-fhut	photomatt&#160;: that's what gallery is also doing.<br />
May 04 16:45:37 chye-fhut	i think.<br />
May 04 16:45:45 photomatt	rboren: as for filtering options/titles, that's somewhat academic. we could do it in a future release. I'd like to filter lower level users through KSES in the next release<br />
May 04 16:46:33 rboren	OK<br />
May 04 16:46:45 MCincubus	multi-user and open-contribution stuff would be pretty high up on my list.<br />
May 04 16:46:51 *	milk has quit ("www.milkmiruku.com / fucking dialup")<br />
May 04 16:46:58 shep	well, is there anything else on the agenda<br />
May 04 16:47:08 jonabad	"new logo"<br />
May 04 16:47:10 photomatt	Yes, tags on the forums<br />
May 04 16:47:18 shep	i don't like them<br />
May 04 16:47:19 photomatt	how do you guys feel they could be done better?<br />
May 04 16:47:22 *	nacken (~nacken@super5300-dialup78.is.com.fj) has joined #wordpress<br />
May 04 16:47:25 shep	but they can be helpful to noobs<br />
May 04 16:47:44 ringmaster	*Confirm* on the feed 304 working properly.<br />
May 04 16:47:52 masquerade	While on the forums, I noticed someone earlier said the "freshness" is a bit confusing<br />
May 04 16:48:02 MCincubus	photomatt, a little sentence explaining them, so pople don't do "having" "a" "problem" "with" "my" "sidebar" as tags because they don't know what tags are for<br />
May 04 16:48:31 masquerade	I second that one<br />
May 04 16:48:32 jonabad	"theme" and "themes" as tags is... frustrating as is a "wordpress" tag<br />
May 04 16:48:34 MCincubus	maybe and e.g.<br />
May 04 16:48:42 westi	tags are good... but they clash a bit with the sub areas of the forums... maybe the areas could be built from the tags instead of by having specific defined areas?<br />
May 04 16:49:02 MCincubus	"For example, if your post is about a plugin that doesn't work with 1.5, you could put "1.5 plugin broken" in the tag section"<br />
May 04 16:49:14 westi	and also a way of creating removing tags from a post you added them to<br />
May 04 16:49:26 photomatt	MCincubus: would you be up for writing an explanation of tags for the Codex?<br />
May 04 16:49:30 westi	for when you create "a very silly tag by accident"<br />
May 04 16:49:35 masquerade	westi, building from tags would make the forums a whole mess of clutter and confusion since there's no way to control what users post as tags<br />
May 04 16:49:59 MCincubus	photomatt, sure.  I'm not on wiki formatting, but Relle has offered to be my translator&#160;:-)<br />
May 04 16:50:02 photomatt	westi: deleting tags is on the agenda<br />
May 04 16:50:19 photomatt	you will be able to delete your own tags and mods will be able to delete other's tags<br />
May 04 16:50:43 MCincubus	how about different colored tags for "added by thread author" or "added by mods"<br />
May 04 16:50:52 MCincubus	Consumating does that<br />
May 04 16:50:56 westi	masquerade: i would counter that build hierarchies from tags would work as a good way of organising the info within the forum as it helps you bring together things on a similar subject easily makes the forum grow more organically<br />
May 04 16:50:57 shep	photomatt: wp t-shirts coming anytime?<br />
May 04 16:51:12 westi	t-shirts++<br />
May 04 16:51:25 shep	and are we letting anyone submit designs?<br />
May 04 16:51:27 masquerade	westi, but not everyone tags alike, and newbies won't immeidately get the concept of "tagging"<br />
May 04 16:51:39 photomatt	want to wait on new schwag for the logo refresh<br />
May 04 16:51:49 ringmaster	Autosuggesting tags could be helpful..<br />
May 04 16:51:57 shep	i like the logo<br />
May 04 16:52:02 skeltoac	When I have time to help/haunt the forums, I would like to see a single list of unanswered posts.<br />
May 04 16:52:03 shep	its simple, just like WP<br />
May 04 16:52:04 photomatt	ringmaster: it needs some AJAX loving<br />
May 04 16:52:22 Podz	skeltoac:: agreed<br />
May 04 16:52:25 masquerade	westi, maybe keeping the structure, but having the option to organize by tags in subcategories<br />
May 04 16:52:26 westi	ringmaster: ... tags based on the subject and existing tags would be good<br />
May 04 16:52:27 photomatt	shep: let's talk about the logo in a few minutes, stick to the forums for now<br />
May 04 16:52:34 shep	any i like my design for the t-shirt: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="../../../../www.mikeschepker.com/wptshirtsmall.jpg">http://www.mikeschepker.com/wptshirtsmall.jpg</a><br />
May 04 16:52:40 shep	will do photomatt<br />
May 04 16:52:40 photomatt	I think flickr's tag interface is pretty ideal<br />
May 04 16:52:44 MCincubus	yeah, I always scan for "1" when I go to the forums.<br />
May 04 16:52:49 westi	masquerade: sounds good... we need to harness the power of tags as an access methog fully<br />
May 04 16:52:50 SteamedPenguin	hmm<br />
May 04 16:52:57 MCincubus	What would help is an "resolved" or "unresolved" status.<br />
May 04 16:53:06 SteamedPenguin	building on technologies like AJAX could have some serious drawbacks<br />
May 04 16:53:17 skeltoac	MC: That too.<br />
May 04 16:53:21 SteamedPenguin	browsers like Opera and Konqueror aren't there yet in current iterations<br />
May 04 16:53:21 photomatt	MCincubus: I agree, I wonder if we could have a special tag for that<br />
May 04 16:53:30 westi	it would also be nice to have a quick link technique for linking to other forum posts by id<br />
May 04 16:53:37 photomatt	SteamedPenguin: Opera is there, Konq can use the HTML version that's there now<br />
May 04 16:53:44 SteamedPenguin	hmm<br />
May 04 16:54:06 SteamedPenguin	Opera 8 reportedly has problems with that new 37 signals app.<br />
May 04 16:54:10 ringmaster	Dojo has great fallback mechanisms for using iframes if the browser doesn't support xmlhttprequest, too.<br />
May 04 16:54:25 skeltoac	Would it be to hard to add a boolean field to each thread? resolved=true/false<br />
May 04 16:54:29 skeltoac	with a checkbox<br />
May 04 16:54:29 SteamedPenguin	BaseCamp<br />
May 04 16:54:35 photomatt	ringmaster: how hard would it be to have a simple in-place tag adder in place of the page refresh we have now?<br />
May 04 16:54:45 photomatt	skeltoac: who would check that box?<br />
May 04 16:54:47 westi	ringmaster: oooh that sounds good.. i have a product in production thats been using iframes to do ajax alike stuff for a few years now<br />
May 04 16:54:47 michel_v	yo<br />
May 04 16:54:56 ringmaster	photomatt: very not hard.<br />
May 04 16:54:56 masquerade	skeltoac, that in itself would be easy, but who should have the right to mark threads as resolved or unresolved and who has the power to change them?<br />
May 04 16:54:57 photomatt	Hi michel_v<br />
May 04 16:55:05 shep	i have to go eat and get a hair cut. good day guys<br />
May 04 16:55:12 shep	keep me posted on logo<br />
May 04 16:55:25 MCincubus	photomatt, they should start "unresolved" and be changed by either the threat starter, or a mod<br />
May 04 16:55:52 skeltoac	I imagine anyone could. I don't imagine it would be a problem.<br />
May 04 16:55:59 MCincubus	probably not...<br />
May 04 16:56:18 michel_v	the thread starter, you surely mean<br />
May 04 16:56:30 photomatt	also some threads don't lend themselves to registration, eg "check out my site"<br />
May 04 16:56:31 MCincubus	michel_v, yeah, although sometimes both&#160;:-\<br />
May 04 16:56:51 michel_v	hmm<br />
May 04 16:56:54 MCincubus	photomatt, those are in a specific section, though, right?<br />
May 04 16:56:54 masquerade	skeltoac, I know a place that tried that on their forums once, and they had a lot of problems with people who reply with suggestions marking the thread as resolved although the poster still didn't understand the post helping out<br />
May 04 16:57:01 photomatt	not registration, I meant resolution<br />
May 04 16:57:15 michel_v	generally, in most support forums, the thread starter is responsible for editing the thread's title with some string like [resolved]<br />
May 04 16:57:19 MCincubus	like "Your WordPress" isn't support.<br />
May 04 16:57:30 ringmaster	"Yes, your site looks good. - Resolved."<br />
May 04 16:57:35 photomatt	ha!<br />
May 04 16:57:44 skeltoac	A lot of people never return to acknowledge resolution. It would be quite a burden on moderators.<br />
May 04 16:57:55 westi	no .. "Your site doesn't look good - Resolved"<br />
May 04 16:57:56 photomatt	ringmaster: does "not hard" mean 30 minutes? a day? a million dollars?<br />
May 04 16:57:57 Podz	I would like Your Wordpress not to figure in the most recent - would remove a lot of clutter<br />
May 04 16:58:00 MCincubus	so, it could be open to the public, via a tag<br />
May 04 16:58:06 photomatt	skeltoac: another good point<br />
May 04 16:58:12 skeltoac	Podz: I second.<br />
May 04 16:58:20 michel_v	I wish "Your Wordpress" threads were absent from the recent threads list<br />
May 04 16:58:28 photomatt	Podz: perhaps it should be removed altogether<br />
May 04 16:58:32 MCincubus	seconded, michel_v <br />
May 04 16:58:43 photomatt	that might be better for an external forum<br />
May 04 16:58:45 michel_v	oh yeah, beat to thepunch by podz<br />
May 04 16:58:49 photomatt	not /support/<br />
May 04 16:58:52 westi	Your Wordpress should be a separate forum from support if it exists at all<br />
May 04 16:58:57 Podz	no .... but just hidden. All it takes is once person to blitz that forum and the front page is full of bumps<br />
May 04 16:59:01 michel_v	I'm mildly drunk&#160;:/<br />
May 04 16:59:39 ringmaster	photomatt: It's basically a matter of adding the Dojo include, creating a javascript array to pass in the input ID and the php file that processes the request, and then having the php file return javascript that will add the new item to the lag list.<br />
May 04 16:59:51 Podz	whichever - would free up the most recent and that has to be good<br />
May 04 17:00:17 ringmaster	So, essentiall about 2 hours to perfection, and a million dollars.  I take checks.<br />
May 04 17:00:43 MCincubus	if we make all /support/ threads actually be support, we can auto-add an "unresolved" tag to each new thread.<br />
May 04 17:00:47 skeltoac	A zero-reply list would still be a great addition, making helping easier.<br />
May 04 17:01:05 MCincubus	that could be a dynamic tag...<br />
May 04 17:01:10 photomatt	skeltoac: zero-reply, one-reply, and needing tags are coming<br />
May 04 17:01:13 MCincubus	when the first reply comes, the "noresponse" goes away<br />
May 04 17:01:15 *	milk (milk@dial81-131-208-192.in-addr.btopenworld.com) has joined #wordpress<br />
May 04 17:02:04 ringmaster	A default checklist of tags might be handy for classifying support issues directly.<br />
May 04 17:02:23 skeltoac	MC, not bad. There is already a function for bolding the titles of unanswered posts.<br />
May 04 17:02:34 photomatt	Podz: I'll look at removing your WP from recent later tdoay<br />
May 04 17:02:48 Podz	photomatt::&#160;:)<br />
May 04 17:02:57 skeltoac	also&#160;:)<br />
May 04 17:03:08 photomatt	ringmaster: since I'm going to be working on bbPress anyway, do you want to coordinate on the AJAX tag part?<br />
May 04 17:04:49 *	twood has quit ("Leaving")<br />
May 04 17:05:06 ringmaster	photomatt: I'd love to, but I'm already stretched a little thin, and I know nothing about bbPress internals already.<br />
May 04 17:06:47 jonabad	photomatt: we're coming up on the end of the hour<br />
May 04 17:07:00 jonabad	next topic?<br />
May 04 17:07:31 photomatt	alright I'll try it out, I'll ping you if I run into anything too weird<br />
May 04 17:07:44 ringmaster	photomatt: Definitely.<br />
May 04 17:07:52 skeltoac	I have a quick announcement for those in the know: BOTD 0.5 is online and very slick. I'd especially like to see if it works as expected on photomatt.net.<br />
May 04 17:07:55 MCincubus	We should start a Codex page for these meetups, where people can suggest topics ahead of time.<br />
May 04 17:08:13 masquerade	MCincubus, photomatt did that earlier<br />
May 04 17:08:21 *	Sanne (~Sanne@p548DA138.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) has joined #wordpress<br />
May 04 17:08:55 MCincubus	Hot... found it.<br />
May 04 17:10:35 photomatt	<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="../../../IRC_Meetups.html">http://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups</a><br />
May 04 17:10:46 photomatt	okay all that's left is the "new logo"<br />
May 04 17:10:46 traveller	hm.....the same get_sidebar(); call produces two different results<br />
May 04 17:10:53 photomatt	just some background<br />
May 04 17:11:20 photomatt	the main problem with the current logo is it doesn't really have a "mark" that translates well onto different mediums and sizes<br />
May 04 17:11:48 traveller	i modified the sidebar.php to display my profile, in the main page it does so, but if click on another link it doesn't display the profiles, just a blank section with heading<br />
May 04 17:11:52 MCincubus	Right, like six aparts "dots"<br />
May 04 17:11:56 photomatt	I like the WP logo typography though<br />
May 04 17:12:19 jonabad	so like a "WP" mark?<br />
May 04 17:12:27 photomatt	exactly<br />
May 04 17:12:29 ringmaster	Yes, such a 16x16 or otherwise square-shaped logo would be very useful.<br />
May 04 17:12:41 photomatt	more like a refinement of the current logo rather than doing something completely different<br />
May 04 17:12:48 jonabad	because I also like the typographic look to it, it has gravitas<br />
May 04 17:12:56 *	dantekgeek has quit (Read error: 60 (Operation timed out))<br />
May 04 17:12:57 photomatt	agreed<br />
May 04 17:13:02 MCincubus	So, "WP" in the blue/black<br />
May 04 17:13:11 photomatt	so I've been working with a designer on some new things<br />
May 04 17:13:29 photomatt	it's still black and white because that's how logo work is done, so colors don't change your perception of the mark<br />
May 04 17:13:51 skeltoac	I envision a simplified image of an old drum litho press with WP rolling out<br />
May 04 17:14:18 photomatt	we've gone through about five iterations, would you guys like a peek and to give some feedback?<br />
May 04 17:14:25 skeltoac	YES!<br />
May 04 17:14:27 jonabad	sock it to me<br />
May 04 17:14:28 MCincubus	absolutely<br />
May 04 17:14:33 photomatt	okay<br />
May 04 17:14:37 photomatt	one note beforehand<br />
May 04 17:14:39 ringmaster	No.   Oh, wait... yes!<br />
May 04 17:14:50 photomatt	there is going to be X percentage of people that will dislike ANY change<br />
May 04 17:15:06 skeltoac	granted<br />
May 04 17:15:10 photomatt	for example, the feedback wired.com got on their CSS redesign got was overwhelmingly negative<br />
May 04 17:15:29 photomatt	even though most people would agree (and newcomers much preferred) the new look is better<br />
May 04 17:15:39 MCincubus	people are more willing to express negative feedback..<br />
May 04 17:15:49 photomatt	so in dealing with anything you have a lot of experience with that may be changing, keep an open mind&#160;:)<br />
May 04 17:16:14 photomatt	and form your opinion before coming back to the channel to see what other people say<br />
May 04 17:16:43 jonabad	less suspense!<br />
May 04 17:16:44 masquerade	in short, don't be influenced by what others think<br />
May 04 17:16:49 *	skeltoac falls of the end of his chair<br />
May 04 17:17:02 skeltoac	Where's the link?<br />
May 04 17:17:10 photomatt	okay let me upload<br />
May 04 17:17:10 jonabad	hasn't happened yet<br />
May 04 17:17:28 chye-fhut	new variation of WP logo?<br />
May 04 17:17:31 *	chye-fhut scrolls up.<br />
May 04 17:17:49 *	NiallKennedy has quit (Remote closed the connection)<br />

May 04 17:18:25 SteamedPenguin	interesting<br />
May 04 17:18:38 SteamedPenguin	it is more colorscheme neutral<br />
May 04 17:18:49 jonabad	these should have letters or something to identify which one we're talking about<br />
May 04 17:18:57 Podz	looks like the VW logo . ...<br />
May 04 17:19:02 photomatt	color will be added later, right now it's just working on the shape<br />
May 04 17:19:06 photomatt	font, etc<br />
May 04 17:19:07 ringmaster	Podz: That's what I was thinking.<br />
May 04 17:19:10 mikelittle	Of the two. 4.01 keeping the singel word works better for me.<br />
May 04 17:19:25 neuro`	re<br />
May 04 17:19:27 masquerade	I like 4.01, for the same reason as mikelittle <br />
May 04 17:19:30 jonabad	4.01 #1 for me with the capitalized W and P<br />
May 04 17:19:52 jonabad	the w in the circle, not so much a fan of<br />
May 04 17:19:57 MCincubus	It's "WordPress," not "Word Press", so splitting it up will kill that distinction.<br />
May 04 17:20:12 SteamedPenguin	MCincubus: aye aye<br />
May 04 17:20:27 MCincubus	Best of the bunch... 4.01, top<br />
May 04 17:20:27 mikelittle	I'm not sure about the camel case. I always type it wrongly. Maybe its time to drop it. Meaning the lower version on 4.01 <br />
May 04 17:20:29 masquerade	my only suggestion might be to make the W and P slightly larger<br />
May 04 17:20:44 chye-fhut	i think so too, MCincubus <br />
May 04 17:21:05 masquerade	just a tad larger, not much, but a tad larger than 4.01 top<br />
May 04 17:21:16 MCincubus	I might go for a more daring shape than a perfect circle on the "W" logo<br />
May 04 17:21:35 westi	photomatt: i do't like it with the W in the middle .. it doesn't work for me .. the 4.01 one looks gooed though<br />
May 04 17:21:50 photomatt	or separate the words?<br />
May 04 17:22:05 westi	ok it's getting late here... time for bed.. see you all again soon<br />
May 04 17:22:55 *	westi is now known as westi|gone<br />
May 04 17:23:17 SteamedPenguin	nah<br />
May 04 17:23:23 SteamedPenguin	wordpress should be one word<br />
May 04 17:23:23 MCincubus	I say "WordPress"<br />
May 04 17:23:26 Podz	How does it look 32*32 or smaller&#160;? For footers and such&#160;?<br />
May 04 17:23:32 mikelittle	A thought, if you separate the words would that make it less able to be trademarked. It becomes an ordinary english phrase.<br />
May 04 17:23:40 Podz	MCincubus:: agreed<br />
May 04 17:23:44 MCincubus	mikelittle, point<br />
May 04 17:23:51 SteamedPenguin	I like wordpress <br />
May 04 17:23:55 MCincubus	or rather, "WORDPRESS" but with "smallcaps"<br />
May 04 17:24:01 photomatt	Podz: the circle W scales well to different sizes<br />
May 04 17:24:02 SteamedPenguin	camel casing it has no real value IMHO<br />
May 04 17:24:11 photomatt	I also think it would look nice on hats/shirts/thongs/etc<br />
May 04 17:24:19 masquerade	hehe, thongs<br />
May 04 17:24:22 Podz	thongs ....<br />
May 04 17:24:25 masquerade	always found that funny<br />
May 04 17:24:38 photomatt	if you look at the current thong, I had to break up Word/Press on separate lines<br />
May 04 17:24:41 Podz	heh .. I'd have to have MT on mine then&#160;:)<br />
May 04 17:25:15 skeltoac	Here's what I meant about the litho drum: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="../../../../www.skeltoac.com/wp-skeltoac.jpg">http://www.skeltoac.com/wp-skeltoac.jpg</a><br />
May 04 17:25:24 *	ringo999 has quit (Connection timed out)<br />
May 04 17:25:51 skeltoac	Except I hurriedly did it upside-down.<br />
May 04 17:26:07 *	geeksmakemeZZZ yawns<br />
May 04 17:26:09 phenny	geeksmakemeZZZ: 05:26Z &lt;BigJibby&gt; ask geeksmakemeZZZ what her techno rank is?<br />
May 04 17:26:21 MCincubus	Hm... I like the idea.<br />
May 04 17:26:50 SteamedPenguin	not sure what the litho drum accomplishes<br />
May 04 17:26:53 masquerade	I think it'd be neat to have some sort of "press" above the words or something, but don't listen to me, I suck at artsy stuff<br />
May 04 17:26:57 skeltoac	That's the kind of physical object WordPress makes me think of.<br />
May 04 17:27:31 MCincubus	the problem with that is that is' not a complicated 3-d logo<br />
May 04 17:27:32 geeksmakemeZZZ	phenny, tell BigJibby  geeksmakemehot.com  Technorati Rank: 2,991<br />
May 04 17:27:34 phenny	geeksmakemeZZZ: I'll pass that on for you when bigjibby is around.<br />
May 04 17:27:38 photomatt	alright, thanks for the feedback everybody&#160;:)<br />
May 04 17:27:39 geeksmakemeZZZ	thanks phenny<br />
May 04 17:27:41 phenny	Why, don't mention it.<br />
May 04 17:27:41 mikelittle	To make it really work, you would need to add perspective to the 'wordpress' giving it an italic slope in a flat b/w rendition<br />
May 04 17:27:43 *	geeksmakemeZZZ is now known as geeksmakemehot<br />
May 04 17:28:03 skeltoac	mikelittle: My PaintShop demo just expired or I would have&#160;:(<br />
May 04 17:28:21 mikelittle	skeltoac:&#160;:-)<br />
May 04 17:28:54 *	jonabad (~jonabad@ppp-70-244-48-245.dsl.hstntx.swbell.net) has left #wordpress<br />
May 04 17:29:34 masquerade	so, does this conclude the IRC meetup?<br />
May 04 17:30:07 photomatt	BANG<br />
May 04 17:30:09 MCincubus	Do we have any other PRESSING business?<br />
May 04 17:30:19 *	skeltoac slaps MCincubus around a bit with a large trout<br />
May 04 17:30:24 photomatt	speak now or hold your peace for a week<br />
May 04 17:30:27 MCincubus	Oof<br />
May 04 17:30:55 MCincubus	photomatt, cool to add ideas to the Codex page for next time?<br />
May 04 17:31:17 SteamedPenguin	photomatt: so 1.5.1 in a week-ish?<br />
May 04 17:31:47 photomatt	SteamedPenguin: probably much sooner<br />
May 04 17:31:54 photomatt	&lt;/meetup&gt;
