<br />[19:00] &lt;skippy&gt; aloha
<br />[19:00] &lt;stevecooley&gt; Hi
<br />[19:00] &lt;photomatt&gt; waiting for the codex to load with the agenda
<br />[19:00] &lt;mahangu&gt; hey photomatt
<br />[19:00] &lt;photomatt&gt; on a related note, the codex will be down for about 30 minutes tonight
<br />[19:00] &lt;io_error&gt; error_bot: time
<br />[19:00] &lt;error_bot&gt; io_error: 10:00 PM, January 04, 2006
<br />[19:00] &lt;photomatt&gt; the yahoo folks are moving it to a different cluster so it'll be faster
<br />[19:00] &lt;mahangu&gt; mm yahoo hosting
<br />[19:01] &lt;io_error&gt; photomatt: will it stay online after this?
<br />[19:01] &lt;mahangu&gt;&#160;:)
<br />[19:01] &lt;io_error&gt; it seems to go down more than wikipedia, and that's a LOT
<br />[19:01] &lt;photomatt&gt; io_error,  no the plan is for random downtime every hour or so to keep people guessing
<br />[19:01] &lt;shep&gt; photomatt: sweeeet
<br />[19:01] &lt;photomatt&gt; we don't want newbies to rely on documentation so much, they never learn anything
<br />[19:01] * ringmaster bangs on the reload button to keep everyone else from seeing IRC_Meetups before he does.
<br />[19:01] &lt;mahangu&gt; photomatt, great plan&#160;:)
<br />[19:02] &lt;mumbles&gt; hehe
<br />[19:02] &lt;photomatt&gt; wow, it's really not loading
<br />[19:02] &lt;io_error&gt; photomatt: see?
<br />[19:02] &lt;skippy&gt; hooray for Yahoo
<br />[19:02] &lt;photomatt&gt; how timely
<br />[19:02] &lt;io_error&gt; Yeehaw!
<br />[19:02] * ringmaster 's sinister plan succeeds.
<br />[19:02] &lt;skeltoac&gt; Chaos ensued.
<br />[19:02] &lt;photomatt&gt; ringmaster wins, meeting ajourned
<br />[19:02] &lt;mahangu&gt; guys, im kinda pushed here finiship up this damn paper, anyone got the time to help Fink over in #wordpress? i started off with him, but realized i have class in 6 hours
<br />[19:03] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Woo hoo!
<br />[19:03] &lt;mahangu&gt; *finishing
<br />[19:03] &lt;stevecooley&gt; welp, I had one item on the agenda as of about 1:30pm pst
<br />[19:03] &lt;photomatt&gt; okay, we can wing this one, let's get started
<br />[19:03] &lt;photomatt&gt; &lt;meetup&gt;
<br />[19:03] &lt;stevecooley&gt; * helping out with XMLRPC testing / testcases (stevecooley)
<br />[19:03] &lt;photomatt&gt; stevecooley, what was your agenda item?
<br />[19:03] &lt;photomatt&gt; ah, thank you
<br />[19:04] &lt;stevecooley&gt; I'd love to be able to contribute to the XMLRPC effort, I'd love to know how I can help out effectively
<br />[19:04] &lt;skippy&gt; how many hackers use XMLRPC posting tools?
<br />[19:04] &lt;photomatt&gt; that falls nicely into the general plan for today, which was to divide WP into logical sections and then send that list to wp-hackers
<br />[19:04] &lt;masquerade&gt; skippy, -1
<br />[19:04] &lt;stevecooley&gt; I am
<br />[19:04] &lt;stevecooley&gt; Ecto
<br />[19:04] &lt;photomatt&gt; so people can volunteer to "garden" different parts of WP
<br />[19:04] * mahangu has been looking for a good CLI tool to XMLRPC with
<br />[19:05] &lt;stevecooley&gt; I've used Marsedit and Ecto, and IMHO, Ecto wins
<br />[19:05] &lt;photomatt&gt; the motivation is: WP is big, lot's of people want to help out, ryan and I need more sleep&#160;;)
<br />[19:05] &lt;stevecooley&gt; on Mac OS X
<br />[19:05] &lt;masquerade&gt; photomatt, second on the sleep part, maybe there'll be less bugs if you sleep more&#160;;-)
<br />[19:05] * Joins: rboren
<br />[19:05] &lt;mahangu&gt; stevecooley, yes, I've heard lots of good things about Marsedit.
<br />[19:05] &lt;photomatt&gt; speak of the devil!
<br />[19:05] &lt;stevecooley&gt; mahangu: I'd recommend you try out Ecto first
<br />[19:05] &lt;photomatt&gt; masquerade, I plan to compensate by coding drunk
<br />[19:06] &lt;mumbles&gt; hehehe
<br />[19:06] &lt;masquerade&gt; photomatt, I find that actually works out occasionally
<br />[19:06] &lt;mahangu&gt; photomatt, great idea, with more beers, all bugs are shallow
<br />[19:06] * mumbles keeps out of the coding work couse he cant do it
<br />[19:06] &lt;masquerade&gt; photomatt, you might not be able to understand it later, but a lot of the time, it works, and works damn well
<br />[19:06] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Did someone say beer?
<br />[19:06] &lt;stevecooley&gt; Anyway, folks, the deal is that when I post to WP using Ecto, I almost always get errors.. I think I might be smart enough to at least report what I'm seeing
<br />[19:07] * Joins: OMEITOR
<br />[19:07] &lt;photomatt&gt; ryan can confirm this, but I believe the official drinks of WP development are B&amp;B and drumbuie
<br />[19:07] &lt;mahangu&gt; isn't this because XMLRPC is flaky spec as it is? or is it really bad implementation on our part?
<br />[19:07] &lt;photomatt&gt; stevecooley, that sounds excellent
<br />[19:07] &lt;photomatt&gt; mahangu, I think it's because none of our core people use XML-RPC regularly
<br />[19:07] &lt;mahangu&gt; (in reference to what stevecooley says)
<br />[19:07] &lt;stevecooley&gt; how and where can I do this so that someone who's closer to the code can make my observations hopefully useful
<br />[19:07] &lt;photomatt&gt; the spec is fine, yada yada
<br />[19:07] &lt;mahangu&gt; photomatt, probably that too, yes
<br />[19:08] &lt;photomatt&gt; stevecooley, well trac.wordpress.org is always good
<br />[19:08] * mahangu is willing to try out / test a XMLRPC tool if there is a good free one for *nix
<br />[19:08] &lt;stevecooley&gt; The weird part is that it tends to work ok, but I get these parsing errors on submission
<br />[19:08] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Can someone recommend a few that we can target?
<br />[19:08] &lt;photomatt&gt; but we're about to sectionize (new verb) WP and you could volunteer for the xml-rpc part and get an inside track
<br />[19:08] &lt;skippy&gt; Ecto and w.Bloggar are the names I hear a lot.
<br />[19:08] &lt;rboren&gt; Yes, ecto is the big one.
<br />[19:08] &lt;skippy&gt; photomatt: volunteers need coordinators.
<br />[19:08] &lt;stevecooley&gt; Ecto is pretty good
<br />[19:09] &lt;skippy&gt; coordinators need to know how to coordinate.
<br />[19:09] &lt;photomatt&gt; skippy, indeed
<br />[19:09] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; and Flock and performancing for ff
<br />[19:09] &lt;masquerade&gt; photomatt, I do believe the verb is sectionalize&#160;;-)
<br />[19:09] &lt;skippy&gt; people "volunteering" won't help.  We need a plan.
<br />[19:09] &lt;photomatt&gt; and coders need to know how to code, and testers how to test
<br />[19:09] &lt;mahangu&gt; agreed
<br />[19:09] &lt;mahangu&gt;&#160;:)
<br />[19:10] &lt;photomatt&gt; anyway, let's get started on the division
<br />[19:10] &lt;skippy&gt; what is expected of the cooridnators?  How do they report back?  Regular ol' trac tickets?  That threatens to lose them.
<br />[19:10] &lt;photomatt&gt; xml-rpc is a first no brainer
<br />[19:10] &lt;photomatt&gt; skippy, let's talk about that next, after this
<br />[19:10] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; what are we talking about? sorry im late ..
<br />[19:10] &lt;mahangu&gt; photomatt, something i constantly feel is that coders with l33t skillz and enough free time (masquerade comes to mind) aren't used enough by WP&#160;:)
<br />[19:10] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Is this just for sectioning users into testing groups?
<br />[19:10] &lt;photomatt&gt; OMEITOR, ways to divide WP into sections that different people can take responsibility for
<br />[19:10] &lt;masquerade&gt; mahangu, why me? lol
<br />[19:11] &lt;mahangu&gt; so this is excellent (what we're doing now)
<br />[19:11] &lt;stevecooley&gt; I'd love to help with the XMLRPC, but I don't think I'm close enough to the specs and the code to own it
<br />[19:11] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; the development?
<br />[19:11] &lt;mahangu&gt; masquerade, just one example&#160;:)
<br />[19:11] &lt;photomatt&gt; for example, a xml-rpc lead can be in charge of making sure xml-rpc works. both development and testing
<br />[19:11] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; or you mean like microsoft
<br />[19:11] &lt;OMEITOR&gt;&#160;:)
<br />[19:11] &lt;photomatt&gt; or at least verified testing
<br />[19:11] &lt;skeltoac&gt; stevecooley: You don't have to be a coder to be a coordinator.
<br />[19:11] &lt;mahangu&gt; OMEITOR, the DIRTY word&#160;:o
<br />[19:11] &lt;photomatt&gt; right now we're brainstorming different sections
<br />[19:11] &lt;photomatt&gt; let's just throw them out, decide which ones to keep later
<br />[19:11] &lt;photomatt&gt; xml-rpc
<br />[19:11] &lt;photomatt&gt; trackbacks/pingbacks
<br />[19:11] &lt;ringmaster&gt; wp-admin
<br />[19:11] &lt;skeltoac&gt; User system
<br />[19:11] &lt;stevecooley&gt; I'm probably a good intelligent user that a higher level coder could work with to test things out
<br />[19:11] &lt;masquerade&gt; WYSIWYG
<br />[19:11] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; comments/trackbacks
<br />[19:12] &lt;photomatt&gt; roles
<br />[19:12] &lt;photomatt&gt; javascript/wysiwyg
<br />[19:12] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; plugin api
<br />[19:12] &lt;masquerade&gt; Rewrites
<br />[19:12] &lt;photomatt&gt; themes
<br />[19:12] &lt;ringmaster&gt; template tags
<br />[19:12] &lt;skippy&gt; categories
<br />[19:12] &lt;stevecooley&gt; skeltoac: good point,
<br />[19:12] * mahangu watches the buzzwords fly
<br />[19:12] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; importers
<br />[19:12] &lt;skeltoac&gt; security
<br />[19:12] &lt;ringmaster&gt; Of course, the stuff we don't list here is the stuff that REALLY needs attention.
<br />[19:12] &lt;masquerade&gt; mahangu, tags, ajax, Web 2.0, anything with an uppercase X
<br />[19:12] &lt;photomatt&gt; in-line documentation
<br />[19:13] &lt;masquerade&gt; translations
<br />[19:13] &lt;photomatt&gt; pages
<br />[19:13] &lt;ringmaster&gt; feeds
<br />[19:13] &lt;photomatt&gt; uploading and management, media
<br />[19:13] &lt;photomatt&gt; link manager
<br />[19:13] &lt;photomatt&gt; performance/speed
<br />[19:13] &lt;stevecooley&gt; this conversation needs a wiki page
<br />[19:13] &lt;rboren&gt; And multiply all of that by the number of hosting environments.
<br />[19:13] &lt;photomatt&gt; stevecooley, it will have one
<br />[19:13] &lt;ringmaster&gt; plugin API
<br />[19:13] &lt;stevecooley&gt;&#160;:D
<br />[19:13] &lt;mahangu&gt; photomatt, just remembered, I have a matter to table as well (after all this)
<br />[19:13] &lt;photomatt&gt; yes, PHP environments
<br />[19:14] &lt;photomatt&gt; mahangu, okay, ping me with it in a PM
<br />[19:14] &lt;photomatt&gt; support
<br />[19:14] &lt;photomatt&gt; codex
<br />[19:14] &lt;masquerade&gt; MySQL versions
<br />[19:14] &lt;mahangu&gt; photomatt, i think we need to have IIS testing, ive seen some complaints. i know, i mean who even hosts on IIS, but there are apparently a few
<br />[19:14] &lt;photomatt&gt; okay

<br />[19:15] &lt;ringmaster&gt; stevecooley: You lie!
<br />[19:15] &lt;skippy&gt; a high-level usability group?
<br />[19:15] &lt;mahangu&gt; codex loads!
<br />[19:16] &lt;photomatt&gt; no need for question marks, everything is valid at this stage, just brainstorming
<br />[19:16] &lt;photomatt&gt; we'll decide how to organize it in a few minutes
<br />[19:16] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; ok
<br />[19:16] &lt;skippy&gt; back-end WP infrastructure ("Matt doesn't scale")
<br />[19:16] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; feature requests

<br />[19:17] &lt;photomatt&gt; same for themes
<br />[19:17] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; ^^^
<br />[19:17] &lt;photomatt&gt; browser testing
<br />[19:18] &lt;mahangu&gt; the fragmentation of various plugin repos?
<br />[19:18] &lt;skippy&gt; did we miss anything?  Oh, the kitchen sink.
<br />[19:18] &lt;mahangu&gt; masquerade, what's up with elixir/alchemy
<br />[19:18] &lt;photomatt&gt; mahangu, shhh, later!
<br />[19:18] &lt;masquerade&gt; GOD! I KNEW someone would bring that up
<br />[19:18] &lt;photomatt&gt; marketing
<br />[19:18] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; themes in the theme lists should be properly tested

<br />[19:19] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; (yeah i found it&#160;:) )
<br />[19:19] &lt;skippy&gt; okay, so we've enumerated lots of aspects of WordPress.  Now what?
<br />[19:19] &lt;photomatt&gt; any more ideas before we stop brainstorming?
<br />[19:19] &lt;photomatt&gt; I think we've got pretty good coverage
<br />[19:20] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; themes
<br />[19:20] &lt;stevecooley&gt; codex page all these things, and people sign up for what they want to help on&#160;?
<br />[19:20] &lt;photomatt&gt; would someone like to collate the last 5 minutes of suggestions into a list? then we can go through and decide what's most important
<br />[19:20] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; i dont mean the .net domain, but the wp.org page
<br />[19:21] &lt;mahangu&gt; photomatt, im on it
<br />[19:21] * mumbles stops listing
<br />[19:21] &lt;photomatt&gt; mahangu, okay, give us a link to the wiki page when you're done
<br />[19:21] * Quits: io_error ("Leaving"�)
<br />[19:22] &lt;photomatt&gt; to address skippy's issue
<br />[19:22] &lt;photomatt&gt; I think almost everything suggested is reasonable
<br />[19:22] &lt;photomatt&gt; I'd be interested to see which areas people have interest helping in
<br />[19:22] &lt;photomatt&gt; both here and from the wp-hackers audience
<br />[19:22] &lt;photomatt&gt; and then I'll work my butt off to provide whatever those folks need to get started
<br />[19:23] &lt;photomatt&gt; while we're waiting
<br />[19:23] &lt;photomatt&gt; there is an "extra" server from the old wordpress.com setup
<br />[19:23] &lt;photomatt&gt; very powerful, runs cpanel so it'd be easy to host lots of people on
<br />[19:23] &lt;photomatt&gt; I've been thinking it'd be nice to make it available for whoever has WP projects but doesn't want to or can't host them
<br />[19:24] &lt;photomatt&gt; free for WP projects
<br />[19:24] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; you mean like theme development and plugins
<br />[19:24] &lt;OMEITOR&gt;&#160;?
<br />[19:24] &lt;photomatt&gt; yes
<br />[19:24] &lt;mumbles&gt; that would be nice
<br />[19:24] &lt;photomatt&gt; that could avoid things liken when the elixir project lost some code a few weeks ago
<br />[19:24] &lt;photomatt&gt; or even like when binarybonsai kep going down because the bandwidth from people downloading kubrick was too high
<br />[19:24] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; but how can you be sure nobody uses it for the pr
<br />[19:25] &lt;photomatt&gt; I've done this on an ad-hoc basis in the past
<br />[19:25] &lt;photomatt&gt; I host themes.wordpress.net for example, though it's on an old slow box right now
<br />[19:25] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; but the chances of something like kubrick happening again are really low
<br />[19:25] &lt;stevecooley&gt; hey
<br />[19:25] &lt;stevecooley&gt; can you move it to the fast new box?&#160;:)
<br />[19:25] &lt;photomatt&gt; maybe that's what wordpress.net could become? like sourceforge for WP projects
<br />[19:26] &lt;photomatt&gt; cpanel provides subdomains, email, mailing lists, almost everything people could need
<br />[19:26] &lt;photomatt&gt; SVN is already available on the wp-plugins/themes sites
<br />[19:26] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; isn't there something open source that does something like sourceforge?
<br />[19:26] &lt;photomatt&gt; OMEITOR, yes, but the software is a bear
<br />[19:26] &lt;OMEITOR&gt;&#160;:(
<br />[19:26] &lt;photomatt&gt; I'd rather just provide the equivalent of what people would get if they paid $10/mo to bluehost or similar
<br />[19:27] &lt;photomatt&gt; stevecooley, I can move it to the faster box&#160;:)
<br />[19:27] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; still, there's no way you can be sure it'll be used for themes and plugins only
<br />[19:27] &lt;mumbles&gt; it would have to be hevily poilced
<br />[19:27] &lt;stevecooley&gt; photomatt: sweeeet!  will that change any IP addresses or anything like that?
<br />[19:27] &lt;photomatt&gt; it wouldn't be open signup
<br />[19:27] &lt;photomatt&gt; people would apply and be accepted
<br />[19:27] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; besides there are only a few themes and plugins that are that popular
<br />[19:27] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; and those are mainly hosted on dedicated servers
<br />[19:28] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; and the ads pay for the stuff usually..
<br />[19:28] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; get my point?
<br />[19:28] &lt;photomatt&gt; people can still do that, the goal is just to remove barriers
<br />[19:28] &lt;mumbles&gt; hehe my theme idea hasent got off the ground yet.&#160;:p
<br />[19:28] &lt;photomatt&gt; there are security implications to having people on wordpress.org
<br />[19:29] &lt;photomatt&gt; wordpress.com is free but too limited for any development
<br />[19:29] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; i agree
<br />[19:29] &lt;photomatt&gt; so a middle ground&#160;:)
<br />[19:29] &lt;skippy&gt; while we're waiting for mahangu to compile the list, can you address what options are available to enhancing the back-end support for the _servers_ and their software?  So when things go wonky, or a trac spam run starts, reliable people can step in as they are available?
<br />[19:29] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; you could just let the people host on wp.com
<br />[19:29] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; and for the actual development use wp.net
<br />[19:30] &lt;photomatt&gt; mahangu, how's it going?
<br />[19:30] &lt;mahangu&gt; skippy, just waiting for the codex to load up for me&#160;:) two seconds
<br />[19:30] &lt;mahangu&gt; photomatt, above
<br />[19:30] &lt;mahangu&gt; it's being sporadic
<br />[19:30] &lt;skippy&gt; pastebin it for the time being, mahangu
<br />[19:30] &lt;photomatt&gt; skippy, could you clarify?
<br />[19:30] &lt;skippy&gt; we can move it from pastebin to codex when codex becomes responsive
<br />[19:30] &lt;photomatt&gt; trac and SVN is hosted by textdrive
<br />[19:31] &lt;photomatt&gt; wp.org itself has been moved off textdrive
<br />[19:31] &lt;photomatt&gt; the codex is on yahoo
<br />[19:31] &lt;skippy&gt; photomatt: adding Codex administrators; modifying bbPress cofnigurations; stuff that currently requires your intervention
<br />[19:31] &lt;photomatt&gt; actually codex admins can be added
<br />[19:31] &lt;skippy&gt; what about resetting Codex passwords?
<br />[19:32] &lt;skippy&gt; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://pastebin.bafserv.com/2474">http://pastebin.bafserv.com/2474</a>  &lt;-- topic list
<br />[19:32] &lt;photomatt&gt; skippy, I'm not sure what the prob is there. I'm guessing there's a bug with sending mail?
<br />[19:32] &lt;mahangu&gt; oh sorry, forgot wpbot isn;'t in here
<br />[19:32] &lt;mumbles&gt; can we have a backup codex&#160;?
<br />[19:32] &lt;skippy&gt; photomatt: sending mail seems not to work, yes.  But a SQL query can reset a user's passwords.  Are you the only one who can reset passwords?
<br />[19:33] &lt;mumbles&gt; for when codex goes down - if it ever happerns again
<br />[19:33] &lt;skippy&gt; whatever happened to the single sign-on plugin?
<br />[19:33] &lt;mumbles&gt; or an link to download the codex
<br />[19:33] &lt;photomatt&gt; skippy, I don't know
<br />[19:33] &lt;skippy&gt; sorry, I'm switching gears.  lets focus on Codex passwords
<br />[19:33] &lt;mahangu&gt; photomatt, skippy&#160;: have i missed anything in that?
<br />[19:33] &lt;skippy&gt; you mentioned that we can't upgrade?  Who has tried what steps?
<br />[19:34] &lt;photomatt&gt; I have tried upgrading, and brion vibber from wikipedia/mediawiki has walked through the code with me
<br />[19:34] &lt;photomatt&gt; I spent a few days on it, no dice
<br />[19:35] &lt;mahangu&gt; perhaps we need to think another wiki engine?
<br />[19:35] &lt;photomatt&gt; well, "if it ain't broke"
<br />[19:35] &lt;photomatt&gt; it's a tiny bit broke right now, I don't want to really break it
<br />[19:35] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; the problem is the db right?
<br />[19:36] &lt;photomatt&gt; I'm happy to provide a DB dump to skippy if he wants to take a whack at it
<br />[19:36] &lt;skippy&gt; sure.  I'll look at it.
<br />[19:36] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; what's the size
<br />[19:36] &lt;photomatt&gt; a few hundred mb
<br />[19:36] &lt;mahangu&gt;&#160;:)
<br />[19:36] &lt;photomatt&gt; we also have the wiki-tech mailing list for this sort of thing
<br />[19:36] &lt;skippy&gt; make a dump available and I'll wget it.
<br />[19:36] &lt;photomatt&gt; skippy, okay. will do
<br />[19:37] &lt;skippy&gt; so back to the testing groups.
<br />[19:37] &lt;photomatt&gt; so is <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://pastebin.bafserv.com/2474">http://pastebin.bafserv.com/2474</a> the final list?
<br />[19:37] &lt;skippy&gt; what is the expectation of how volunteers can contribute?
<br />[19:38] &lt;photomatt&gt; skippy, suggestions?
<br />[19:38] &lt;mahangu&gt; photomatt, yes
<br />[19:38] &lt;skippy&gt; as I said, we need coordination of sort; otherwise we just have groups of data coming in, instead of ungrouped data coming.
<br />[19:39] * mahangu changes topic to '<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="../../../IRC_Meetups.html">http://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups</a> || Currently under discussion - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://pastebin.bafserv.com/2474�'">http://pastebin.bafserv.com/2474�'</a>
<br />[19:39] &lt;photomatt&gt; okay I've got a copy of it here
<br />[19:39] &lt;photomatt&gt; let's eliminate dupes, and then decide what each "section" would entail
<br />[19:39] &lt;mahangu&gt; photomatt, as skippy says, we need a few small (and preferebly) independent teams
<br />[19:39] &lt;photomatt&gt; to make it easier to flesh out the responibilites
<br />[19:40] &lt;photomatt&gt; okay let's combine trackbacks/pingbacks/comments
<br />[19:40] &lt;photomatt&gt; combine user system and roles
<br />[19:40] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; there should be some big groups with divisions
<br />[19:40] * mahangu is making notes, and will amend the list once finished
<br />[19:40] &lt;photomatt&gt; mahangu, don't worry, I'm doing it as we go along
<br />[19:40] &lt;mahangu&gt; ok great
<br />[19:40] &lt;photomatt&gt; combine JS and wysiwyg
<br />[19:40] &lt;skippy&gt; I suggest we step back and review wha the objective is for this.  As I understand it, the objective is to reduce the number of bugs that are present in WordPress releases.
<br />[19:41] &lt;photomatt&gt; skippy, okay
<br />[19:41] &lt;skippy&gt; am I incorrect?
<br />[19:41] &lt;photomatt&gt; is something not clear?
<br />[19:41] &lt;photomatt&gt; reduce bugs, make it easier for people to contribute, divide reponsibility
<br />[19:41] &lt;rboren&gt; Improving test coverage.
<br />[19:42] &lt;masquerade&gt; Real QA
<br />[19:42] &lt;photomatt&gt; I would say it comes down mostly to responsibility
<br />[19:42] &lt;stevecooley&gt; alpha sort: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://pastebin.bafserv.com/2476">http://pastebin.bafserv.com/2476</a>
<br />[19:42] &lt;skippy&gt; I want to make sure that we all understand why this is being done, to eliminate ambiguity.  reduce bugs, contributions, responsibility and QA all make sense to me.
<br />[19:44] &lt;photomatt&gt; does that sound good to everybody?
<br />[19:44] &lt;mahangu&gt; yeah
<br />[19:44] &lt;mahangu&gt; sounds fine
<br />[19:44] &lt;skeltoac&gt; +1
<br />[19:44] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; yeah
<br />[19:44] &lt;masquerade&gt; sounds like what I intended the proposal for&#160;:-P
<br />[19:44] &lt;photomatt&gt; okay what are some other things we can combine on the list?
<br />[19:45] * Quits: ringmaster (Connection timed out�)
<br />[19:45] &lt;mahangu&gt; themes/repos
<br />[19:45] &lt;mahangu&gt; plugins/repos
<br />[19:45] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; plugins could be merged
<br />[19:45] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; yeah
<br />[19:47] &lt;photomatt&gt; okay
<br />[19:48] &lt;photomatt&gt; give me one minute
<br />[19:48] &lt;mahangu&gt; wp-admin/shuttle/dashboard
<br />[19:48] &lt;PotterSys&gt; sorry, but what's shuttle?
<br />[19:48] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; a theme for the admin area
<br />[19:48] &lt;stevecooley&gt; pottersys: +1
<br />[19:49] &lt;skeltoac&gt; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=wordpress+shuttle">http://www.google.com/search?q=wordpress+shuttle</a>
<br />[19:49] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; or something like that
<br />[19:49] &lt;mahangu&gt; PotterSys, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.brokenkode.com/shuttle">http://www.brokenkode.com/shuttle</a>
<br />[19:49] &lt;PotterSys&gt; heh; thanks to all
<br />[19:49] &lt;mahangu&gt; it's weird that we've not seen any betas or screenshots
<br />[19:49] &lt;mahangu&gt; or have we?
<br />[19:50] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; not that i know of
<br />[19:50] &lt;masquerade&gt; that reminds me, I do love that text on WordPress.org about the admin area being completely redesigned, after a few color changes
<br />[19:50] &lt;photomatt&gt; masquerade, thanks
<br />[19:51] &lt;MichaelH&gt; a merged documentation=codex/in-line documentation/feature requests/coding standards/devblog posting/ maybe translations
<br />[19:51] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; devblog is more marketing/pr
<br />[19:52] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; i think..
<br />[19:52] &lt;mahangu&gt; i was gonna say that
<br />[19:52] &lt;photomatt&gt; okay here - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://pastebin.bafserv.com/2477">http://pastebin.bafserv.com/2477</a>
<br />[19:52] &lt;photomatt&gt; too bad we can't all use subethaedit or something
<br />[19:53] &lt;stevecooley&gt; photomatt: indeed!
<br />[19:53] &lt;photomatt&gt; okay everyone load that up, any suggested changes?
<br />[19:53] &lt;photomatt&gt; we need a bigass internet whiteboard
<br />[19:54] &lt;masquerade&gt; I thought that's what IRC was
<br />[19:54] &lt;masquerade&gt; minus the erasing capability
<br />[19:54] &lt;OMEITOR&gt; i think wp needs the marketing part..
<br />[19:54] &lt;OMEITOR&gt;&#160;:)
<br />[19:54] &lt;stevecooley&gt; baiwb.net is available
<br />[19:55] &lt;mahangu&gt; photomatt, now you're asking for volunteers for each area?
<br />[19:55] &lt;photomatt&gt; mahangu, not quite yet
<br />[19:55] &lt;photomatt&gt; some of these might not be needed
<br />[19:55] &lt;photomatt&gt; xml-rpc is reasonable
<br />[19:56] &lt;photomatt&gt; commenting is important enough it at least needs good testing, particualrly trackback
<br />[19:56] &lt;masquerade&gt; +pingback
<br />[19:56] &lt;photomatt&gt; roles, eh. not sure if that's something someone could focus full-time on
<br />[19:56] &lt;photomatt&gt; same with rewrites/permalinks
<br />[19:56] &lt;skippy&gt; before any release, _every_ supported rewrite configuration should be tested
<br />[19:57] &lt;photomatt&gt; but I guess if this is for testing as well, that's something that needs to be tested
<br />[19:57] &lt;skippy&gt; that can be fairly well automated.
<br />[19:57] &lt;photomatt&gt; well let's start describing each one, starting with xml-rpc
<br />[19:57] &lt;photomatt&gt; that will help us weed out the ones we can't think of enough for
<br />[19:57] &lt;skippy&gt; remote posting tools, a la Ecto, as suggested by stevecooley
<br />[19:58] &lt;photomatt&gt; XML-RPC needs someone to test popular clients
<br />[19:58] &lt;stevecooley&gt; I can test two on the mac
<br />[19:58] &lt;stevecooley&gt; because I've paid for two on the mac
<br />[19:58] &lt;photomatt&gt; and also to look into ways to expand our XML-RPC support on the development side
<br />[19:58] &lt;stevecooley&gt; Like Atom support?
<br />[19:58] &lt;photomatt&gt; yep
<br />[19:59] &lt;photomatt&gt; okay, what does the comments/tb/pb need to cover?
<br />[19:59] &lt;mahangu&gt; anybody seen blogger's 'post from within M$ word' widget? i wonder how hard it'll be to make something like that for wp
<br />[20:00] &lt;masquerade&gt; making sure execute-pings is constantly working, make sure trackbacks and pingbacks are working, both in and out
<br />[20:00] * stevecooley cringes
<br />[20:00] &lt;masquerade&gt; That seems to be one feature that breaks during every cycle
<br />[20:01] &lt;photomatt&gt; okay
<br />[20:01] &lt;photomatt&gt; okay, user system and roles
<br />[20:02] &lt;photomatt&gt;&#160;?
<br />[20:03] &lt;mahangu&gt; basically how they work with new themes, someone needs to write a theme upgrade guide (has Podz already done this?)
<br />[20:03] &lt;mahangu&gt; a couple of themes broke with 2.0, iirc
<br />[20:04] &lt;podz&gt; mahangu, and that should be up to theme authors. Their themes, their work. And there are HUNDREDS  of themes now.
<br />[20:04] &lt;rboren&gt; Most of them don't do that kinda crack.
<br />[20:04] &lt;photomatt&gt; true
<br />[20:05] &lt;mahangu&gt; podz, i agree, but shouldn't we provide some basic documentation. i.e - x should now be written as y?
<br />[20:05] &lt;photomatt&gt; we should help them do the right thing as much as possible
<br />[20:05] &lt;mumbles&gt; my themes work with 2.0
<br />[20:05] &lt;podz&gt; mahangu, "we"&#160;:p
<br />[20:05] &lt;photomatt&gt; the amount of themes with XSS problems is staggering
<br />[20:05] &lt;mahangu&gt; podz, agreed, i wasn't pointing you out.. i just recall you writing an upgrade guide
<br />[20:06] &lt;podz&gt; I'll do guides so long as it's crystal clear. No guide = no blame in many ways.  Make a mistake in a guide ...&#160;?
<br />[20:06] &lt;masquerade&gt; photomatt, I still contend that with 2.0 we should've provided functions and cleaned variables that had the search related stuff, and unset($_GET<br />['s])
<br />[20:06] &lt;podz&gt; I'm no coder. I know nothing of XSS and suchlike. So _I_ would need to know first

<br />[20:08] &lt;photomatt&gt; improving HTML compatibility
<br />[20:08] &lt;photomatt&gt; right now we deal *really* badly with more than basic HTML

<br />[20:10] &lt;skeltoac&gt; dbx
<br />[20:10] &lt;mahangu&gt; photomatt, are we moving for a bugfix release? 2.0.1 or something? or are we waiting for a feature release?
<br />[20:10] &lt;photomatt&gt; mahangu, later
<br />[20:11] &lt;mahangu&gt; sorry, my bad

<br />[20:12] * Joins: tunicwriter
<br />[20:12] &lt;photomatt&gt; bundled themes?
<br />[20:12] &lt;mumbles&gt; needs to be looked at
<br />[20:12] &lt;mahangu&gt; photomatt, yes, a few non bulky ones
<br />[20:12] &lt;mumbles&gt; ones that are esily changed
<br />[20:13] &lt;podz&gt; ones that need no plugins
<br />[20:13] &lt;photomatt&gt; browser testing
<br />[20:13] &lt;mumbles&gt; with &lt;-- comments --&gt; that meen stuff
<br />[20:13] &lt;skeltoac&gt; They could be updated to work with the newest features supported in themes, without going too far overboard.
<br />[20:13] &lt;mumbles&gt; xhtml transiltional valid
<br />[20:14] &lt;mahangu&gt; yes
<br />[20:14] &lt;photomatt&gt; sounds good
<br />[20:14] &lt;photomatt&gt; template tags?
<br />[20:14] &lt;mumbles&gt; kindof like what ive been trying to do but failing
<br />[20:14] &lt;photomatt&gt; I'm not sure what would fall under template tags, nix it?
<br />[20:15] &lt;mumbles&gt; just include support in the themes for stuff like the calendar thing
<br />[20:15] &lt;photomatt&gt; okay, next up is "categories"
<br />[20:16] &lt;skippy&gt; making sure add / delete / rename / re-nest categories works
<br />[20:16] &lt;skeltoac&gt; could be part of a larger group
<br />[20:17] &lt;photomatt&gt; okay
<br />[20:17] &lt;photomatt&gt; inline documentation
<br />[20:17] &lt;photomatt&gt; including bits of documentation to explain non-intuitive parts of WP
<br />[20:17] &lt;photomatt&gt; and linking to further help
<br />[20:18] &lt;skippy&gt; do you mean inline in the code?
<br />[20:18] &lt;mumbles&gt; making shore the help means something to people
<br />[20:18] &lt;skippy&gt; I would love to see better commenting in the code.
<br />[20:18] &lt;photomatt&gt; I mean bundled with WP
<br />[20:18] &lt;skippy&gt; okay.
<br />[20:18] &lt;photomatt&gt; skippy, this is user facing, not source code necessarily
<br />[20:18] &lt;skippy&gt; okay.
<br />[20:18] &lt;photomatt&gt; improving brevity and clarity of text
<br />[20:19] &lt;skeltoac&gt; For example, the WYSIWYG help button
<br />[20:19] &lt;mumbles&gt; nice wording
<br />[20:19] &lt;photomatt&gt; okay <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Matt/WordPress_Responsibilities">http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Matt/WordPress_Responsibilities</a> updated
<br />[20:19] &lt;photomatt&gt; "pages"
<br />[20:19] &lt;photomatt&gt; improving WP's usefullness as a CMS
<br />[20:20] &lt;photomatt&gt; "feeds"
<br />[20:20] &lt;photomatt&gt; ensuring compliance
<br />[20:20] &lt;photomatt&gt; testing major aggregators
<br />[20:21] &lt;photomatt&gt; adding support for new standards
<br />[20:22] * skippy is now known as skippy|away
<br />[20:22] &lt;photomatt&gt; okay, "uploading and management, media"
<br />[20:23] &lt;photomatt&gt; skeltoac?
<br />[20:23] &lt;skeltoac&gt; Attachment-only uploading hasn't made everyone happy.
<br />[20:24] &lt;skeltoac&gt; We might ought to bring back some old features in new clothes.
<br />[20:24] &lt;skeltoac&gt; Compat is an issue. Server setups are wildly variable.
<br />[20:24] &lt;photomatt&gt; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Matt/WordPress_Responsibilities">http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Matt/WordPress_Responsibilities</a> updated
<br />[20:25] &lt;skeltoac&gt; mime type support could be expanded.
<br />[20:26] &lt;skeltoac&gt; Enclosure types should also be reviewed
<br />[20:26] &lt;photomatt&gt; okay sounds good
<br />[20:26] &lt;photomatt&gt; "link manager"
<br />[20:27] &lt;photomatt&gt; OPML import/export
<br />[20:27] &lt;photomatt&gt; display functions
<br />[20:27] &lt;mumbles&gt; options to have differnt themes
<br />[20:27] &lt;photomatt&gt; UI improvement
<br />[20:27] &lt;mumbles&gt; on differnt pages
<br />[20:27] &lt;photomatt&gt; "performance"
<br />[20:28] &lt;photomatt&gt; benchmarking
<br />[20:28] &lt;photomatt&gt; profiling
<br />[20:28] &lt;photomatt&gt; identifying bottlenecks
<br />[20:28] &lt;photomatt&gt; optimizations
<br />[20:28] &lt;skeltoac&gt; cache
<br />[20:28] &lt;photomatt&gt; Plugin API
<br />[20:28] &lt;photomatt&gt;&#160;?
<br />[20:29] &lt;photomatt&gt; don't think we need anything specific there, it's more broad
<br />[20:29] &lt;photomatt&gt; design / aesthetics
<br />[20:29] &lt;photomatt&gt; making WP "purty"
<br />[20:29] &lt;photomatt&gt; typography
<br />[20:30] &lt;skeltoac&gt; Not to be owned by a coder, but to have access to coders to implement design decisions
<br />[20:30] &lt;photomatt&gt; color coorditanio
<br />[20:30] &lt;photomatt&gt; speling
<br />[20:30] &lt;photomatt&gt;&#160;;)
<br />[20:30] &lt;skeltoac&gt; ah yeah
<br />[20:30] &lt;mumbles&gt; ah - cant help there
<br />[20:31] &lt;photomatt&gt; usability should fall under that too
<br />[20:33] &lt;photomatt&gt; coding standards
<br />[20:33] &lt;photomatt&gt; ensuring WP code is consistent and readable
<br />[20:33] &lt;photomatt&gt; security
<br />[20:33] &lt;photomatt&gt; regularly auditing user input and sanitation
<br />[20:34] &lt;photomatt&gt; alright updated

<br />[20:35] &lt;photomatt&gt; codex is timing out again, damnit
<br />[20:35] &lt;mumbles&gt; i have a copey open
<br />[20:35] &lt;mumbles&gt; about 3 updates ago
<br />[20:35] &lt;mumbles&gt; could pastbin that
<br />[20:35] &lt;photomatt&gt; let me pastebin the latest
<br />[20:35] &lt;mumbles&gt; k
<br />[20:36] &lt;photomatt&gt; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Matt/WordPress_Responsibilities">http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Matt/WordPress_Responsibilities</a>
<br />[20:36] &lt;photomatt&gt; sorry - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://pastebin.bafserv.com/2478">http://pastebin.bafserv.com/2478</a>
<br />[20:36] &lt;photomatt&gt; copy and paste never works right on ubuntu
<br />[20:37] &lt;photomatt&gt; okay, there's not a whole lot of feedback so I'll finish this on my own and send it to the hackers list
<br />[20:37] &lt;photomatt&gt; any other topics before ending the meetup?
<br />[20:37] &lt;mumbles&gt; nothing i can think of
<br />[20:38] &lt;mumbles&gt; we have covered my main "anoyence"
<br />[20:38] &lt;skeltoac&gt; Anyone else still awake?
<br />[20:38] &lt;stevecooley&gt; I'm back, sorry, I had a 3pm meeting
<br />[20:38] &lt;photomatt&gt; my plan of boring everyone away worked
<br />[20:38] &lt;skeltoac&gt; +1
<br />[20:38] &lt;skeltoac&gt; organizational meetings are too good at that
<br />[20:39] &lt;photomatt&gt; I blame skippy, because he's not here
<br />[20:39] &lt;stevecooley&gt; ok, so just so I catch the important stuff before we end
<br />[20:39] &lt;mumbles&gt; he
<br />[20:39] &lt;mumbles&gt; photomat++
<br />[20:39] &lt;stevecooley&gt; we're going to start figuring out who's going to help out on each of these things next time? or during the week or something?
<br />[20:40] &lt;skeltoac&gt; back to lists
<br />[20:40] &lt;mumbles&gt; im up for helping out wherever i can
<br />[20:40] &lt;mumbles&gt; mainly on theme stuff
<br />[20:40] &lt;mumbles&gt; and testing the user docs
<br />[20:41] &lt;stevecooley&gt; so yeah, it seems like we should be able to sign up under these lists where we want to make ourselves available
<br />[20:41] &lt;mumbles&gt; differnt mailing lists or somethign for each topic&#160;?
<br />[20:41] &lt;mumbles&gt; forum posts&#160;?
<br />[20:41] &lt;photomatt&gt; I'm going to send the whole thing to wp-hackers
<br />[20:42] &lt;photomatt&gt; I'm not sure the best way for the groups to communicate
<br />[20:42] &lt;mumbles&gt; googles wp-hackers
<br />[20:42] &lt;photomatt&gt; it doesn't really matter, whatever works best for the people involved
<br />[20:42] &lt;mahangu_&gt; no, keep it on one list
<br />[20:42] &lt;mumbles&gt; theres always going to be the mailing list - instent messageing crowd
<br />[20:42] * mahangu_ is already subscribed to a gazillion dev lists
<br />[20:42] &lt;stevecooley&gt; uh, there's like 50 topics here, aren't there??
<br />[20:43] &lt;mumbles&gt; what is the address to catch all the lists&#160;?
<br />[20:43] &lt;mahangu_&gt; photomatt, i tabled the topic of the codex. any comment on that?
<br />[20:43] &lt;mahangu_&gt; stevecooley, exactly
<br />[20:43] &lt;photomatt&gt; what about it?
<br />[20:43] &lt;mahangu_&gt; mumbles, there are only two afaik
<br />[20:43] &lt;mahangu_&gt; well three
<br />[20:43] &lt;mahangu_&gt; wp-docs, wp-hackers, wp-testers
<br />[20:44] &lt;PotterSys&gt; mumbles: when codex is working, check <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="../../../Mailing_Lists.html">http://codex.wordpress.org/Mailing_Lists</a>
<br />[20:44] &lt;photomatt&gt; wp-forums, wp-design, wiki
<br />[20:44] &lt;photomatt&gt; we have lots of mailing lists
<br />[20:44] &lt;photomatt&gt; wp-polyglots
<br />[20:44] &lt;photomatt&gt; wp-supersecret
<br />[20:44] &lt;mahangu_&gt; photomatt, i assume the codex will have another 'group' of people working on it, under this new structure
<br />[20:45] &lt;mahangu_&gt; wp-web20?
<br />[20:45] * mahangu_ shuts up
<br />[20:45] &lt;photomatt&gt; codex already has wp-docs
<br />[20:45] &lt;stevecooley&gt; more like "web 5.4"
<br />[20:45] &lt;mahangu_&gt; yup
<br />[20:46] &lt;photomatt&gt; the codex has remained pretty healthy, I'm not worried about it right now
<br />[20:47] &lt;mahangu_&gt; photomatt, it has stopped growing in the way it used to. we need to get #wordpress-docs going, along with a renewed interest in it
<br />[20:47] &lt;mahangu_&gt; i know not where relle is, but someone needs to do what she did
<br />[20:47] &lt;stevecooley&gt; Is there any way to arbitrarily create mail lists on wp.org?
<br />[20:48] &lt;photomatt&gt; stevecooley, no
<br />[20:48] &lt;photomatt&gt; but I'll create one if someone asks and has a good reason
<br />[20:48] &lt;mumbles&gt; joined
<br />[20:48] &lt;mumbles&gt; now who has ops in there&#160;?
<br />[20:48] &lt;stevecooley&gt; photomatt: is there enough there for an xmlrpc testing list?
<br />[20:48] &lt;mahangu_&gt; mumbles, does it matter?
<br />[20:49] &lt;photomatt&gt; if you could get 5-10 people to join, then yes
<br />[20:49] &lt;mahangu_&gt; photomatt, once we have all this sorted out, i suggest another codex drive (a week?)
<br />[20:49] &lt;mumbles&gt; mahangu - not really
<br />[20:49] &lt;stevecooley&gt; ok, classic chicken or egg problem&#160;:)
<br />[20:50] &lt;photomatt&gt; mahangu, that'd be worth bringing up on wp-docs
<br />[20:51] &lt;photomatt&gt; okay I'm exhausted, let's call it
<br />[20:51] &lt;photomatt&gt; &lt;/meetup&gt;
<br />[20:51] &lt;photomatt&gt; see you all next week
