As a community, we want to embrace the very differences that have made our collaboration so powerful, and work together to provide the best environment for learning, growing, and sharing of ideas. It is imperative that we keep Sass a fun, welcoming, challenging, and fair place to play.</p> </div> <p>As such, the Sass Community Guidelines states our ideals as a community.&nbsp;It&#39;s meant to be a guide on how we work together and conduct ourselves, not&nbsp;a specific rulebook. It is a way to communicate our existing values to&nbsp;the entire community, and share our values with the&nbsp;‘verse.</p> <h2>We strive&nbsp;to:</h2> <h3>Be&nbsp;considerate</h3> <p>Our work will be used by other people, and we in turn will depend on the&nbsp;work of others. Any decision we take will affect users and colleagues, and&nbsp;we should consider them when making&nbsp;decisions.</p> <h3>Be open and&nbsp;inviting</h3> <p>Our community has grown immensely because of the diversity that is&nbsp;found within the community. We welcome all individuals regardless of, but&nbsp;not limited to, their gender identity and expression, sexual&nbsp;orientation, preferred relationship model, disability, physical appearance, body size,&nbsp;age, race, or religious affiliation. We take pride in the the richness&nbsp;of experiences that have come to help develop Sass, and want to continue&nbsp;growing our community. In short, <strong>everyone is welcome, except those who&nbsp;are unwelcoming</strong>.</p> <h3>Be&nbsp;respectful</h3> <p>Disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. We work together to&nbsp;resolve conflict, assume good intentions and do our best to act in an&nbsp;empathetic fashion. We treat those who don’t use Sass with respect; they&nbsp;understand their own needs better than anyone else. We don&#39;t allow frustration&nbsp;to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel&nbsp;uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. <strong>Harassment of anyone,&nbsp;either within the Sass community or outside of it, is never&nbsp;okay</strong>.</p> <h3>Take responsibility for our words and our&nbsp;actions</h3> <p>We can all make mistakes; when we do, we take responsibility for them.&nbsp;If someone has been harmed or offended, we listen carefully and respectfully,&nbsp;and work to right the&nbsp;wrong.</p> <h3>Be&nbsp;collaborative</h3> <p>What we produce is a complex whole made of many parts; it is the sum of&nbsp;many dreams. Collaboration between teams that each have their own goal and&nbsp;vision is essential; for the whole to be more than the sum of its parts, each&nbsp;part must make an effort to understand the&nbsp;whole.</p> <p>Collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our&nbsp;work. Internally and externally, we celebrate good collaboration. Wherever&nbsp;possible, we work closely with upstream projects and others in the free&nbsp;software community to coordinate our efforts. We prefer to work transparently&nbsp;and involve interested parties as early as&nbsp;possible.</p> <h3>Value decisiveness, clarity and open&nbsp;communication</h3> <p>Disagreements, social and technical, are normal, but we do not allow them&nbsp;to persist and fester leaving others uncertain of the agreed&nbsp;direction.</p> <p>We expect participants in the project to resolve disagreements&nbsp;constructively. When they cannot, we escalate the matter to either designated leaders at&nbsp;the event or within the community to arbitrate and provide clarity and&nbsp;direction.</p> <h3>Be responsive and&nbsp;helpful</h3> <p>All of us started as new and inexperienced. Even the most experienced of&nbsp;us may forget things. Nobody is expected to be perfect in this&nbsp;community. Questions are encouraged and those who are asked should endeavor to&nbsp;be responsive, courteous, and helpful. When off topic, please direct to&nbsp;the appropriate forum. Even when the question is common and repeatedly asked,&nbsp;even when the documentation explains it, remember that they have only asked it&nbsp;once and they may have read, but not understood. Ultimately, it is better to&nbsp;give no answer than an unfriendly&nbsp;one.</p> <h3>Step down&nbsp;considerately</h3> <p>When somebody leaves or disengages from the community, we ask that they do&nbsp;so in a way that minimizes disruption to the projects using their published&nbsp;work. They should tell people they are leaving and take the proper steps to&nbsp;ensure that others can pick up where they left&nbsp;off.</p> </div> </div> <div class=sl-l-large-holy-grail__complementary> <h3>License</h3> <p>Our friends at <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/conduct">Ubuntu</a> and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/dcoc">Drupal</a> have already worked hard to develop their own community guidelines, and we borrow heavily from them.

This should include the publication of a Code of Conduct that includes clear anti-harassment procedures.
